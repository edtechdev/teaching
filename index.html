         <h3>FPDS Purpose</h3>
         <p>The Center for Innovative Teaching and Technology&#8217;s (CITT) Faculty Professional Development Services (FPDS) provides an environment that fosters the development and delivery of engaging, innovative instruction and technologies promoting successful student learning opportunities.</p>
         <h3>FPDS Goals</h3>
         <p>Under the leadership of the Vice President of Academic Affairs, and managed by the Director of Professional Development, the Center for Innovative Teaching and Technology FPDS is charged to support the institutional mission by performing the following functions:</p>
         <ul>
              <li>Provide and coordinate instructional design services, in-service activities, and training opportunities for faculty to gain skills and knowledge in support of student success</li>
              <li>Develop, research, and maintain instructional resources and best practices to be used across the wide array of college curricula</li>
              <li>Encourage and support the integration of instructional technologies used in various delivery methods at the college</li>
              <li>Support and coordinate teaching and learning events and experiences related to all course modalities.</li>
              <li>Provide customized pathways of professional development to meet specified faculty goals</li>
         </ul>
         <h3>FPDS Events</h3>
         <p>There are four major faculty professional development events each year:</p>
         <ul>
              <li>August &#8211; Fall Full-time In-service and (separately) Adjunct Faculty In-service</li>
              <li>October &#8211; FPD Day (faculty professional development)</li>
              <li>January &#8211; Spring Full-time Faculty In-service</li>
              <li>March &#8211; All College Day</li>
         </ul>
         <p>Youâll receive emails with more information about these events, including opportunities to present your own workshops and sessions. Many of the sessions offer FPD (faculty professional development) credit hours. The fall and spring in-service general sessions are required for all full-time faculty, and the fall adjunct in-service general session is required for all adjunct faculty.</p>
         <h3>FPDS Training</h3>
         <p>Youâll receive FPD credit hours for participating in training courses and workshops. Full-time faculty are required to obtain at least 20 FPD hours a year, and adjunct faculty 10 hours.</p>

              <p class="import-Normal">The student body is very diverse and beyond simple stereotypes or perceptions. Below are some resources on supporting students of different types, demographics, and needs.</p>
              <h3><a id="_sqw0wfxd01hc"></a>Generation Z and Alpha students</h3>
              <p class="import-Normal">Generation Z students were born between 1995 and 2010. Generation Alpha students were born between 2010 and 2025. As noted in the HCC data presented earlier, these âtraditionalâ age students coming to college straight out of high school are a minority of students at HCC. Nontraditional, older students also make up a significant percentage of enrollment.</p>
              <p class="import-Normal">Both Z and Alpha generations have grown up through significant challenges (such as pandemics and recessions), as well as significant technological and societal changes (such as smartphones, social media, high speed Internet, and AI). However, one should not assume students of these generations are necessarily more proficient in their technological skills. There is no such thing as âdigital natives.â Technological proficiency is more correlated with socioeconomic status (SES, see below for resources on supporting low-SES students).</p>
              <p class="import-Normal">There are no characteristics that are inherent or innate to a particular generation, and even shared cultural circumstances are not experienced the same by all. Making assumptions about a student or a group of students based on age, gender, race, appearance, or other factors, is a bias we need to be cautious about. See a later section for resources on mitigating biases such as ageism.</p>

              <h3><a id="_6htx0im0m2cj"></a>Dual Enrollment Students</h3>
              <p class="import-Normal">Dual enrollment students complete HCC courses while still in high school. Often the courses are offered at the high school. This helps students get an early start on their college progress and eases the transition to college. A recent <a class="rId210" href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/15210251231170331">systematic review</a> found that dual enrollment programs have positive effects on student success:</p>
              <p class="import-Normal" style="margin-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt"><em>Using meta-analytic techniques, we find that across the 162 study effect sizes included in our analysis, participation in dual enrollment programs was positively associated with grade point average (GPA), total earned college credits, college enrollment, early persistence, degree attainment, and full-time attendance. Also, we find negative associations between dual enrollment and time to graduation and total semesters enrolled in college, indicating these programs can help students graduate college more quickly.</em></p>

              <h3><a id="_bzkpgf80mwsr"></a>Nontraditional Students</h3>
              <p class="import-Normal">Nontraditional students (sometimes referred to as âadult learnersâ) are typically 25 years or older. Many are coming from the workplace, and they may be more likely to have families, children, and other obligations. A significant portion of community college students are nontraditional. Nationally, approximately 40% of college students are nontraditional. Nontraditional students are retained at a lower rate than traditional students; however, a recent <a class="rId217" href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/15210251221138065">study</a> found that adult student retention is boosted by engagement factors such as active and collaborative learning, student effort, academic challenge, student-faculty interaction, and support for learners. Here are some more resources about nontraditional, adult learners:</p>

              <p class="import-Normal">First-generation students are the first in their family to attend college. They may not have the family or social supports students often depend on to help acclimate and succeed in college. There is a âhidden curriculumâ of unwritten rules and practices and expectations in college, for which some students may be unaware. A <a class="rId222" href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/00915521231163903">study</a> looked at the difference between first-generation and continuing generation students:</p>
              <p class="import-Normal" style="margin-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt"><em>First-generation college students (FGCSs) place more importance on achieving college-related goals and face greater difficulties from college- and other life-related challenges than continuing-generation college students (CGCSs).</em></p>
              <p class="import-Normal" style="margin-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt"><em>These findings indicate that community colleges should offer more support to FGCSs pertaining to studentsâ goals and challenges so that all community college students may be successful in their academic pursuits.</em></p>

              <p class="import-Normal">Low socioeconomic status (SES) students come from backgrounds and families with less income and economic support. Some students may even be homeless or have food insecurity. Low SES can make things more difficult or impossible, such as commuting to school, purchasing textbooks and supplies, accessing computers and the Internet, and paying tuition.</p>
              <p class="import-Normal">One <a class="rId236" href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07294360.2023.2197191">study</a> included anecdotal testimonies from low-SES students:</p>

              <p class="import-Normal" style="margin-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt"><em>For Anthony, making connections and developing relationships with academic staff was a key strategy utilised for success.</em></p>

              <p class="import-Normal">Student veterans actively serve in the military or served in the past. They may or may not be combat veterans. Itâs important not to stereotype or lump student veterans into one category, as one <a class="rId253" href="https://sr.ithaka.org/blog/the-importance-of-student-veteran-belonging/">report</a> notes:</p>
              <p class="import-Normal" style="margin-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt"><em>Student veterans are not who most faculty members, administrators, and other students think they are. For more than a decade, the image of the typical student veteran was shaped by the public image of combatants returning from Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom, more commonly known as the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, respectively. In our conversations, campus leaders said that one of the most pervasive and pernicious stereotypes that campus stakeholders have about student veterans is that they all suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). PTSD continues to loom large in the American imagination as it is both a very real consequence of military service for some veterans and also an all-too-easy stereotype about anyone with military experience.</em></p>

              <h3><a id="_9ce8b3v85u3b"></a>Students with Disabilities</h3>
              <p class="import-Normal">Students may have permanent, temporary, or situational disabilities that are visual, auditory, motor, or cognitive in nature, as illustrated in the diagram below from <a class="rId259" href="https://inclusive.microsoft.design/tools-and-activities/Inclusive101Guidebook.pdf">Microsoft Inclusive Design</a>:</p>
              <p class="import-Normal"><img src="http://pressbooks.hccfl.edu/teaching/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2024/07/image9.png" alt="image" width="319.583727034121px" height="593.4px" /></p>
              <p class="import-Normal">Thus, not all students who need support or accommodations may have permanent and declared disabilities. Some disabilities are invisible, including cognitive (neurodivergent) disabilities such as ADHD and autism. Such students often suffer from a stigma against disabilities. Some estimates suggest over 40% of people may have permanent, temporary, or situational disabilities. One should not also look on students with disabilities with a âdeficit lensâ, as students who are lesser than and need to be fixed. Instead, one can adopt an âasset lensâ and explore the strengths of these students, in line with a more <a class="rId261" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_model_of_disability">social model of disability</a>:</p>
              <p class="import-Normal" style="margin-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt"><em>The social model of disability identifies systemic barriers, derogatory attitudes, and social exclusion (intentional or inadvertent), which make it difficult or impossible for disabled people to attain their valued functionings. The social model of disability diverges from the dominant medical model of disability, which is a functional analysis of the body as a machine to be fixed in order to conform with normative values.</em></p>
              <p class="import-Normal">According to the <a class="rId262" href="https://www.cast.org/impact/universal-design-for-learning-udl">Universal Design for Learning</a> framework, revising our teaching to be more inclusive and accommodating to student differences can benefit all students, not just those with disabilities. Some example accommodating strategies include:</p>
              <ul>
                   <li class="import-Normal" style="text-indent: 18pt">Ensuring all your videos have accurate captions and all your images have accurate descriptions (âalt textâ).</li>
                   <li class="import-Normal" style="text-indent: 18pt">Being flexible in your due dates, giving students second chances to complete their work.</li>
                   <li class="import-Normal" style="text-indent: 18pt">Sharing your lecture notes or slides, and letting students take notes using laptops or other devices if need be.</li>
                   <li class="import-Normal" style="text-indent: 18pt">Sharing lecture recordings or letting students record lectures, especially for students for whom English is a second language or who have cognitive or auditory impairments.</li>
                   <li class="import-Normal" style="text-indent: 18pt">Reducing or removing the use of timed exams and quizzes, or at least offering extended time for students who request it.</li>
                   <li class="import-Normal" style="text-indent: 18pt">Making attendance more flexible.</li>

              <h3><a id="_o8qtccljb8pj"></a>Latino Students</h3>
              <p class="import-Normal">HCC is a <a class="rId280" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hispanic-serving_institution">Hispanic Serving Institution</a> (HSI). HSIs are colleges and universities that enroll at least 25% Hispanic students and receive federal grants to support their education and stability.</p>
              <p class="import-Normal">What is the difference between Hispanic, Latino, Latina, and Latinx? According to a <a class="rId281" href="https://medschool.duke.edu/blog/ask-oedi-hispanic-latino-latina-latinx-which-best">resource</a> from Duke University Medical School:</p>
              <p class="import-Normal" style="margin-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt"><em>Hispanic refers to a person with ancestry from a country whose primary language is Spanish.</em></p>
              <p class="import-Normal" style="margin-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt"><em>Latino and its variations refer to a person with origins from anywhere in Latin America (Mexico, South and Central America) and the Caribbean.</em></p>
              <p class="import-Normal" style="margin-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt"><em>What about Latino, Latina, and Latinx? What do those endings mean?</em></p>
              <p class="import-Normal" style="margin-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt"><em>These words are all gendered forms of the same word. Spanish is a gendered language, which means all nouns have either a feminine or masculine form. Feminine-associated words typically end in âaâ, while masculine-associated words typically end in âo.â Spanish has no gender-neutral nouns or pronouns (like our âtheyâ or âitâ), so all nouns have to end in one of these forms.</em></p>
              <p class="import-Normal" style="margin-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt"><em>The term âLatinxâ attempts to correct this problem by offering a gender-neutral version of the term that does not end in âoâ or âa.â However, this alternative creates some problems of its own. To start, words donât naturally end in an âxâ sound in Spanish, making the word sound awkward when spoken. Additionally, some members of the Latino community feel this term has been imposed on them by an English-speaking, mostly academic audience.</em></p>

              <h3><a id="lgbtq"></a>LGBTQ+ Students</h3>
              <p>According to the <a href="https://www.everylearnereverywhere.org/resources/equity-review-tool/">Equity Evaluation Tool</a>, LGBTQIA2S+ is an âacronym for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, intersex, asexual, two-spirit (used particularly by Indigenous communities), and more. Sometimes, when the Q is seen at the end of LGBT, it can also mean questioning. LGBT and/or GLBT are also often used. The term âgay communityâ should be avoided, as it does not accurately reflect the diversity of the community. Rather, LGBTQ+ community is preferred (Achieving the Dream, 2022).â</p>
              <p>According to the <a href="https://pnpi.org/factsheets/lgbtq-students-in-higher-education/">LGBTQ Students in Higher Education factsheet</a>, 17% of undergraduate and graduate students identified as gay, lesbian, bisexual, asexual, queer, or questioning. 1.7% of undergraduate and graduate students identified their gender as transgender, nonbinary, or questioning.</p>
              <p>â<a href="https://code.likeagirl.io/5-ways-to-become-a-skilled-lgbtq-advocate-d63c64b65c7a">5 Ways to Become a Skilled LGBTQ+ Advocate</a>â shares some tips for being an ally and advocate for LGBTQ+ students and all people, including:</p>
              <blockquote>
                   <p><em>Regardless of whether someone is part of the LGBTQ+ communities or not, asking everyone how they would like to be addressed and how to pronounce their name is a great way to make everyone feel included and respected. This also takes the awkwardness out of singling someone out and having to ask them for this information directly.</em></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>According to the journal <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abn3759"><em>Science</em></a>:</p>
              <blockquote>
                   <p><em>It is important to recognize the context-dependent and multidimensional nature of sex. Rather than privilege any characteristic as the sole determinant of sex, âmaleâ and âfemaleâ should be treated as context-dependent categories with flexible associations to multiple variablesâ¦.No one trait determines whether a person is male or female, and no personâs sex can be meaningfully prescribed by any single variable.</em></p>
                   <p><em>Awareness of the distinction between sex and gender is another vital element to inclusive, quality research. Conflating the two harms and invalidates gender minorities by implying that these distinct attributes are inextricably linked.</em></p>

              <h3><a id="_ka462fmqy1m1"></a>Female Students</h3>
              <p class="import-Normal">Women have historically been underrepresented in some professional fields of study, <a class="rId305" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_STEM_fields">in particular STEM fields</a> such as physics, engineering, and computer science. Below is a graph of the percentage female students earning undergraduate STEM degrees by major (via the <a class="rId306" href="https://www.ncwit.org/resources/ncwit-scorecard-status-women-computing-2019-update">NCWIT Scorecard on The Status of Women in Computing</a>). Nationwide, only about 20% of engineering and computer science graduates are female (bottom two lines).</p>
              <p class="import-Normal"><img src="http://pressbooks.hccfl.edu/teaching/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2024/07/image8.png" alt="image" width="624px" height="397.333333333333px" /></p>
              <p class="import-Normal">Implicit and explicit negative stereotypes about women and other underrepresented groups in STEM affect their interactions and success in school and the workplace.</p>
              <p class="import-Normal">There is <a class="rId308" href="https://www.aauw.org/resources/research/the-stem-gap/">no evidence of innate gender differences in math and science ability</a>, but boys are more likely than girls to pursue careers in math-intensive fields such as engineering and physics. Female STEM majors in college are more likely to drop out, transfer, or change to non-STEM majors than male students. This also is not due to differences in ability. <a class="rId309" href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0157447">Women are 1.5 times more likely to leave the STEM pipeline after taking Calculus I</a>, for example, partly because of non-academic reasons such as a lack of mathematical confidence.</p>
              <p class="import-Normal">What are other reasons for why female students may leave STEM majors? One reason involves their âsense of belongingâ and their identification and connection with their chosen STEM profession.</p>
              <p class="import-Normal" style="margin-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt"><em>âWe found that women students who have had either one-on-one contact with, or media exposure to, same-gender professors, experts or peers, feel âI belong here.â This in turn makes them more confident about their abilities, more likely to persist in math, science, and engineering majors, and more interested in pursuing careers in these fields after graduation. This happens when female students see same-gender experts and peers in fields where they are typically a tiny minority, such as engineering, mathematics, computer science, physics, and astronomyâ (</em><a class="rId310" href="https://www.nsf.gov/discoveries/disc_summ.jsp?cntn_id=189603&amp;WT.mc_id=USNSF_5"><em>Dasgupta, 2016</em></a><em>).</em></p>
              <h4><a id="_nzezn32uhsx1"></a>Strategies for Supporting the Success of Female Students in STEM</h4>
              <p class="import-Normal">What are some strategies you as a faculty member can use in your classroom, your department, and in your interactions with students to help support the success of female students?</p>
              <ul>
                   <li class="import-Normal" style="text-indent: 18pt">Incorporate stories of the work of women scientists or engineers related to the content of the class, or invite female scientists or engineers to be guest speakers in your class. (<a class="rId311" href="https://www.nsf.gov/discoveries/disc_summ.jsp?cntn_id=189603&amp;WT.mc_id=USNSF_5">Dasgupta, 2016</a>)</li>
                   <li class="import-Normal" style="text-indent: 18pt">âOne of the things that we know works is to use team-based activities to create an environment where youâre not competing for grades and where everyone helps each other. You need an environment which not only values the people who answer the questions first, but tries to engage the entire class â rather than always having one or two people, usually males, dominating the conversation.â (<a class="rId312" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/07/31/women-in-engineering_n_5631834.html">Klawe, 2014</a>)</li>
                   <li class="import-Normal" style="text-indent: 18pt">When forming teams, instead of trying to equally distribute different types of members, which leads to many teams with only one female student, encourage the formation of teams in which women are not the minority. (<a class="rId313" href="https://www.nsf.gov/discoveries/disc_summ.jsp?cntn_id=189603&amp;WT.mc_id=USNSF_5">Dasgupta, 2016</a>)</li>
                   <li class="import-Normal" style="text-indent: 18pt">Use a peer mentor system where upper level female students serve as peer mentors to incoming women. Or perhaps invite former students to come speak to your class or meet with your students. âThese peer mentors fill a niche thatâs different from high-level successful role models because they are closer in age and life stage to their mentees. Peer mentors are a stepping stone on the way to professional success in STEM.â (<a class="rId314" href="https://www.nsf.gov/discoveries/disc_summ.jsp?cntn_id=189603&amp;WT.mc_id=USNSF_5">Dasgupta, 2016</a>)</li>

              <p class="import-Normal">Multiple professional fields of research are devoted to the study of how people (including students) learn, such as the learning sciences, educational psychology, sociology, and other educational research domains. <a class="rId361" href="https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/9853/how-people-learn-brain-mind-experience-and-school-expanded-edition"><em>How People Learn</em></a> is a free foundational and accessible text on the topic. Below is a sampling of some important findings and theories concerning student learning.</p>
              <p class="import-Normal" style="background-color: transparent;margin-left: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt">Students are not a blank slate (âtabula rasaâ). Students have pre-existing knowledge and misconceptions, which can support or hinder new learning if not acknowledged. See for example this video about <a class="rId362" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVtCO84MDj8">Khan Academy and the Effectiveness of Science Videos</a>. And learning does not happen passively by observation or like in <em>The Matrix</em> (âI know kung fuâ). Effective learning is an active and collaborative process. Learning takes effort and action, like with exercise or learning a sport. There is some accuracy to the saying: âI hear and I forget. I see and I remember. I do and I understand.â One of the most heavily researched and established educational psychology findings, for example, is <a class="rId363" href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10648-021-09595-9">retrieval practice</a>, which finds that students learn much more from actively trying to recall and apply information and âtestâ themselves compared to merely re-reading a chapter or watching an instructor lecture or watching someone else show how to solve a problem.</p>
              <h3><a id="_unrnw275z6qe"></a>ICAP Framework</h3>
              <p class="import-Normal" style="background-color: transparent;margin-left: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt">Michilene Chi summarized research on learning with the <a class="rId364" href="https://www.unh.edu/teaching-learning-resource-hub/sites/default/files/media/2023-05/itow-applying-the-icap-framework-to-improve-classroom-learning-chi-boucher.pdf">ICAP Framework</a>, which identifies four types of student learning and engagement: Interactive -&gt; Constructive -&gt; Active -&gt; Passive. Passive learning is inferior to active learning, which is inferior to constructive and interactive learning.</p>
              <p class="import-Normal" style="background-color: transparent;margin-left: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt"><strong>Passive learning</strong> involves passively observing or reading information:</p>
              <p class="import-Normal" style="margin-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt"><em>We define the Passive mode of engagement as learners interacting with instruction physically by orienting towards or paying attention to instruction with no visible outputs produced. For example, paying attention and listening to a teacherâs lecture without taking notes is considered engaging in the Passive mode. Thus, the two overt indices of engaging in the Passive mode are paying attention and producing no visible outputs.</em></p>
              <p class="import-Normal" style="background-color: transparent;margin-left: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt"><strong>Active learning</strong> involves students actively engaging with material, such as interactive with a simulation, playing a game, doing a lab activity, or answering questions in a course.</p>
              <p class="import-Normal" style="margin-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt"><em>Learnersâ engagement with instructional materials is classified as Active when students physically manipulate some parts of the instructional materials, such as pointing to or gesturing at parts of what they are solving or reading (Alibali &amp; DiRusso, 1999), pausing and rewinding parts of a videotape (Chi et al., 2008), underlining certain text sentences (Katayama et al., 2005), copying some problem solution steps (VanLehn et al., 2007), mixing certain chemical amounts in a hands-on laboratory (Yaron et al., 2010), choosing a justification from a menu of options (Conati &amp; VanLehn, 2000), and bookmarking a page in a textbook. The visible outputs produced from manipulating can be identified as information already existing within the content materials.</em></p>
              <p class="import-Normal" style="background-color: transparent;margin-left: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt"><strong>Constructive learning</strong> involves individually creating new information.</p>
              <p class="import-Normal" style="margin-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt"><em>ICAP defines the Constructive mode as having the characteristics of physically generating some external outputs and the external outputs contain additional information that goes beyond what was provided in the learning materials.</em></p>
              <p class="import-Normal" style="margin-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt"><em>Examples include drawing a concept map (Biswas et al., 2005; Novak, 1990a; 1990b); taking notes in oneâs own words (Trafton &amp; Trickett, 2001); asking questions (Graesser &amp; Person, 1994); comparing-and-contrasting cases; integrating two texts (Britt &amp; Sommer, 2004), text and diagrams (Butcher, 2006), or across multimedia resources (Bodemer et al., 2004); inducing hypotheses and causal relations (Suthers &amp; Hundhausen, 2003); drawing analogies (Chinn &amp; Malhotra, 2002); generating predictions (Schauble et al., 1995); reflecting and monitoring oneâs understanding or other self-regulatory activities (Azevedo et al., 2006); constructing timelines for historical phenomena (Dawson, 2004), and self-explaining (Chi et al., 1994).</em></p>
              <p class="import-Normal" style="margin-left: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt"><strong>Interactive learning</strong> expands on the idea of collaborative (or group) learning to include the stipulation that participants are collaboratively generating new information. Examples might include debates, collaborative projects, peer tutoring, critiquing/peer reviewing (and social annotation).</p>
              <p class="import-Normal" style="margin-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt"><em>We define the Interactive mode as collaborations/interactions between students (such as through dialoging) and with instruction that meet two criterial indices: (1) two (or more) students are engaging in reciprocally co-generative behaviors; and (2) the outputs contain information that goes beyond the instructional materials and beyond what each partner contributes individually.</em></p>
              <p class="import-Normal" style="margin-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt"><em>The Interactive mode requires a significant degree of turn-taking so that it allows each partner to incorporate her partnerâs understanding of the domain into her own thinking and to make more frequent adjustments to her own mental model (Chi, 2000).</em></p>
              <h3><a id="_tb9jzbe4r10r"></a>Lecture vs. Active and Collaborative Learning</h3>
              <p class="import-Normal" style="background-color: transparent;margin-left: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt">Approximately <a class="rId365" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6310123/">80% of STEM courses predominantly involve lecture</a>. The <a class="rId366" href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/pandp.20201053">median instructor lectures 89% of the time</a>. Students are <a class="rId367" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24821756/">1.5 times more likely to fail in lecture courses</a> compared to active learning courses. Incorporating active learning into a course not only increases student success and achievement overall, but also <a class="rId368" href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1916903117">decreases equity gaps</a>. See more about active and collaborative learning techniques in a later section on evidence-based teaching strategies.</p>
              <h3><a id="_b77v4ildotxw"></a>Rote Learning vs. Deep Learning and Understanding</h3>
              <p class="import-Normal" style="background-color: transparent;margin-left: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt">Rote learning, also known as surface learning, involves lower-level cognitive activities such as memorizing or recalling information, including studying for or taking a standard test or exam. Approximately <a class="rId369" href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40753-015-0023-9">85% of test questions in math</a> involve rote learning and recall and memorization (âplug and chugâ) and <a class="rId370" href="https://www.lifescied.org/doi/10.1187/cbe.23-12-0244">92% of test questions in biology</a>. An issue is that students tend to quickly forget much of the information they memorized not long after a test or lesson is over. At the end of an introductory psychology course, for example, <a class="rId371" href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1207/S15328023TOP2702_02">students were asked what they remembered from the course</a>, and they only recalled vivid instructional techniques like demonstrations and dramatic videos. Two years after an introductory psychology course was over, <a class="rId372" href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0098628313487417">student performance on the final exam dropped 60%</a>. See the assessment and evidence-based teaching sections below for alternative ideas for enhancing assessment and student learning and understanding.</p>
              <p class="import-Normal" style="background-color: transparent;margin-left: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt">This <a class="rId373" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ng5qzH39nyg">video clip from âMinds of Our Ownâ</a> shows how even Harvard and MIT engineering grads on the day of graduation are often unable to make a bulb light, given a bulb, battery, and wire.</p>
              <p class="import-Normal" style="background-color: transparent;margin-left: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt">Rote learning is contrasted with higher-order thinking, deep learning, and understanding activities such as interpreting information, comparing and contrasting, debating, creating, and designing. <a class="rId374" href="https://cft.vanderbilt.edu/guides-sub-pages/blooms-taxonomy/">Bloomâs taxonomy</a> (figure below) shows these different types of learning in a pyramid diagram, but it is a misconception that this implies that students need to memorize information and facts <em>before</em> they can tackle higher order thinking and practices. In fact, according to research on <a class="rId375" href="https://www.manukapur.com/productive-failure/">productive failure</a> and other areas, students actually learn better in the reverse situation. Give students problems or challenges or data for them to explore and potentially struggle with first, and <em>afterward </em>when they hear a lecture or see other information explaining or clarifying things, theyâll better understand and learn from the lecture, since they have common experiences and unanswered questions to connect the information to. Otherwise, if students hear a lecture or read text <em>before </em>some kind of motivating context or grounding activity, theyâll be less likely to learn, remember, or understand it, as they have no reason for learning it (other than memorizing for a test), and they will quickly forget much of what they learned soon after.</p>
              <p class="import-Normal" style="background-color: transparent;margin-left: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt"><img src="http://pressbooks.hccfl.edu/teaching/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2024/07/image7.jpg" alt="image" width="624px" height="350.666666666667px" /></p>
              <h3><a id="_9esn0pr41hk1"></a>Transfer of Learning</h3>
              <p class="import-Normal">Two related deep learning goals of instruction are to help students gain knowledge and skills that will A) transfer to the real world and their careers, and B) at least in the short term transfer their learning to future courses for which their current course is a prerequisite. Unfortunately, both goals are often not achieved, and they are indeed difficult to achieve, especially when only utilizing traditional teaching and assessment techniques. <a class="rId377" href="https://nap.nationalacademies.org/read/9853/chapter/6">Chapter 3 of </a><a class="rId378" href="https://nap.nationalacademies.org/read/9853/chapter/6"><em>How People Learn</em></a> goes into more depth with examples of transfer and learning, and later sections here on motivation and evidence-based teaching share strategies for contextualizing instruction for better transfer of learning, student engagement, and learning.</p>
              <p class="import-Normal">What students learn abstractly in a math course, for example, <a class="rId379" href="https://peer.asee.org/3778.pdf">often does not transfer</a> to a physics course the very next or even same semester, as well as future engineering or other courses.</p>
              <p class="import-Normal">Nurses <a class="rId380" href="https://www.lifescied.org/doi/10.1187/cbe.23-05-0074">report</a> that their core anatomy and physiology course does not align with the skills and knowledge they need in the profession:</p>
              <p class="import-Normal" style="margin-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt"><em>We investigated the relevance of prerequisite course content for studentsâ careers through semistructured interviews with practicing nurses regarding their undergraduate anatomy and physiology (A&amp;P) courses. Nurses reported that A&amp;P content does not align with the skills and knowledge needed in the nursing profession. Interviewees averaged 39% on a brief A&amp;P assessment, suggesting A&amp;P prerequisites failed to impart a high degree of long-term A&amp;P knowledge among nurses. Further, practicing nurses perceived overcommitment to A&amp;P content coverage as an exclusionary practice that eliminates capable individuals from the prenursing pathway.</em></p>
              <p class="import-Normal">Another issue related to transfer of learning is that you cannot teach some fundamental skill or literacy (like writing, math, communication, information literacy) in a single course or lesson and then expect students to have mastered it or be able to transfer what they may have learned to other contexts. Instead, these fundamental skills and literacies need to be reinforced throughout the curriculum, as exemplified in the <a class="rId381" href="https://wac.colostate.edu/repository/teaching/intro/">Writing Across the Curriculum</a> (WAC) approach and also in various interdisciplinary education initiatives. Other examples include incorporating discipline-specific, real world examples and cases in math and science courses or incorporating computational thinking or information literacy skills in humanities and social sciences and other courses.</p>
              <p class="import-Normal">Another common issue hurting learning and transfer is explored further in the course design section. The issue has been referred to as the â<a class="rId382" href="https://www.liberty.edu/lucom/wp-content/uploads/sites/82/2019/08/Understanding_by_Design.pdf">sin of coverage</a>â &#8211; courses <a class="rId383" href="https://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/podcast/knowledge-at-wharton-podcast/the-objective-of-education-is-learning-not-teaching/">overly focus on content coverage vs. learning and understanding</a>.</p>
              <p class="import-Normal" style="margin-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt"><em>Traditional education focuses on teaching, not learning. It incorrectly assumes that for every ounce of teaching there is an ounce of learning by those who are taught.</em></p>
              <p class="import-Normal">A course design model known as <a class="rId384" href="https://cft.vanderbilt.edu/guides-sub-pages/understanding-by-design/">backward design</a> provides guidance on how to start from the goal of helping students understand big ideas and big questions and working backward from that to assessment and instructional activities.</p>
              <p class="import-Normal">Another set of techniques to help students transfer their knowledge and skills to other contexts is explored further in the metacognition section.</p>

              <p class="import-Normal">Other frameworks and learning theories offer strategies for improving student success and equity and well-being, including metacognition, reflection, and self-regulated learning.</p>
              <p class="import-Normal">Metacognition involves thinking about thinking, or reflecting on your learning. This might be facilitated by incorporating metacognitive prompts in homework or in other assessment activities that encourage students to reflect on their learning and what they know and are doing. See for example <a class="rId391" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ov5Eb5JKCGiVKcPOMNx3EHhhfuXUubOGHls2dnD0ZOI/edit?usp=sharing">minute papers</a> and <a class="rId392" href="https://www.cmu.edu/teaching/designteach/teach/examwrappers/">exam wrappers</a>. Having students write in journals or learning diaries through <a class="rId393" href="https://www.centerforengagedlearning.org/eportfolio-as-high-impact-practice/">eportfolios</a>, blogs, or assignments is another technique to foster metacognitive development through reflection. <a class="rId394" href="https://www.routledge.com/Teach-Students-How-to-Learn-Strategies-You-Can-Incorporate-Into-Any-Course-to-Improve-Student-Metacognition-Study-Skills-and-Motivation/McGuire/p/book/9781620363164"><em>Teach Students How to Learn</em></a> is a book by Saundra McGuire with strategies for helping students become more metacognitive, self-directed learners. See the supporting resources section for PowerPoints used for a lecture she gives to students about <a class="rId395" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGBfd7LeGMM">using metacognition to help students ace exams</a>.</p>
              <p class="import-Normal">Self-regulated learning is a framework for teaching students how to be more metacognitive and adaptive in their learning approaches. Self-regulated learning is correlated with student achievement (<a class="rId396" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1747938X23000593?dgcid=raven_sd_aip_email">Fong et al., 2023</a>), and it is also a trainable skill, not a fixed or innate trait of students. In addition to several strategies detailed in the resources below, an introductory college success course that focuses on research-based strategies for teaching students how learning works and how to âlearn-to-learnâ can have tremendous positive effects on student success. One course <a class="rId397" href="https://oesar.osu.edu/pdf/presentations/Teaching_tuckman_kennedy_AERA2009_Paper_022609.pdf">improved graduation rates by 45%</a>, and <a class="rId398" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YqWUeprlyJd7lrhbQzqE8lUGnN8PfUe1/view">another course</a> improved graduation rates by 30%.</p>
              <p class="import-Normal" style="margin-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt"><em>Students in academic difficulty who took the âLearning and Motivation Strategiesâ course in their first quarter at Ohio State were about 45 percent more likely to graduate within six years than similar students who didnât take the class. Average-ability students who took the course were also six times more likely to stay in college for a second year and had higher grade point averages than those who didnât take the class.</em></p>

              <p class="import-Normal"><a class="rId429" href="https://selfdeterminationtheory.org/the-theory/">Self-determination theory</a> has determined three necessary components of motivation: autonomy, competence, and relatedness, that apply to education, the workplace, parenting, and other contexts.</p>
              <ul>
                   <li class="import-Normal" style="text-indent: 18pt"><strong>Autonomy </strong>is about having control over oneâs life and choices. It contrasts with controlled motivation, which involves being told what to do.

                        <li class="import-Normal" style="text-indent: 18pt">Assessments that support autonomy have positive outcomes, whereas controlled motivation assessments that involve surface learning have negative outcomes (<a class="rId432" href="https://journals.lww.com/academicmedicine/fulltext/2023/09000/the_effect_of_assessments_on_student_motivation.30.aspx">Kursurkar et al., 2023</a>).</li>

                   <li class="import-Normal" style="text-indent: 18pt"><strong>Competence </strong>involves the need to experience mastery, a sense that one can succeed and grow.

                        <li class="import-Normal" style="text-indent: 18pt">If tasks are too challenging or a person receives negative feedback, feelings of competence can decrease.</li>
                        <li class="import-Normal" style="text-indent: 18pt">The need for competence is best satisfied within well-structured environments that afford optimal challenges, positive feedback, and opportunities for growth (<a class="rId433" href="https://msofc.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/2020-Intrinsic-and-Extrinsic-Motivation-from-a-Self-Determination-Theory-Perspective.pdf">Ryan &amp; Deci, 2020</a>).</li>

                   <li class="import-Normal" style="text-indent: 18pt"><strong>Relatedness </strong>concerns a sense of belonging and connection, and being respected and cared for.
                   <ul>

              <ul>
                   <li class="import-Normal" style="text-indent: 18pt"><strong>Meaningful Choices</strong> involve providing students with a range of 3-5 options in assignments, encouraging self-directed learning while offering support and structure.</li>
                   <li class="import-Normal" style="text-indent: 18pt"><strong>Constructive Feedback</strong> includes specific praise, clear improvement directions, and multiple revision opportunities to build trust and mastery.</li>
                   <li class="import-Normal" style="text-indent: 18pt"><strong>Rationale Provision</strong> entails explaining the relevance and future benefits of course materials and assignments, helping students connect tasks to their goals.</li>
                   <li class="import-Normal" style="text-indent: 18pt"><strong>Social Belonging &amp; Cultural Validation</strong> focuses on creating an inclusive environment, validating students&#8217; diverse backgrounds, and promoting a culture of help-seeking and mastery.

              <h3><a id="_51lvr2l9tdf7"></a>Student Engagement</h3>
              <p class="import-Normal">Engagement is an observable byproduct of motivation (<a class="rId445" href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.1045717/full">Nagy et al., 2022</a>) and includes cognitive, behavioral, and emotional responses, such as putting in effort, paying attention, attending class, participating in class, and completing coursework. Engagement is a key predictor of student outcomes, especially in online learning (<a class="rId446" href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07294360.2020.1860912">Brown et al., 2022</a>). A national survey of community college student engagement has found a positive relationship between student retention and five student engagement benchmarks: active and collaborative learning, student effort, academic challenge, student-faculty interaction, and support for learners (<a class="rId447" href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/15210251221138065">Spitzig &amp; Renner, 2022</a>). There are however critiques of engagement as a concept (<a class="rId448" href="https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/ws/portalfiles/portal/138454933/Macfarlane_Tomlinson.pdf">MacFarlane &amp; Tomlinson, 2017</a>), as it may sometimes be a superficial or artificial signal of genuine student motivation and learning.</p>
              <p class="import-Normal">See the teaching section for more resources on increasing student participation, attendance, and engagement, but below is information about two strategies: nudges and contextualized learning.</p>
              <h3><a id="_aool8uby4dgm"></a>Nudges</h3>
              <p class="import-Normal">Nudges are personalized text messages or emails to students to help remind them or encourage their success and make better decisions. These can also be accomplished by one-on-one meetings in person or in videoconferences or phone calls.</p>
              <p class="import-Normal">After an exam, for example, you might try sending tailored individualized messages to students who struggled (or else meet with them virtually or in person) and discuss study strategies and how to use the learning goals more effectively to target their studying. In a <a class="rId449" href="https://cwsei.ubc.ca/sites/default/files/cwsei/outcomes/SEIresearch/Harris_Intervention_JCST2012.pdf">study</a> of this technique, both students who had an in-person meeting with the instructor and those who only received an email improved their performance on the following exam.</p>

              <h3><a id="_k6xpnjx3jix9"></a>Increasing Student Engagement with Everyday Examples &amp; Problem-Based Learning</h3>
              <p class="import-Normal"><a class="rId463" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Situated_learning">Situated learning</a>, or contextualized learning, is the idea that all learning is inextricably tied to the context in which it happens â the activities, the physical and social context, and the culture in which learning occurs. Other related names for this principle include situated cognition, encoding specificity, culturally enhanced learning, and simulation. <a class="rId464" href="https://www.academia.edu/232847/Constructivism_Embodied_Cognition_Enactivism_Theoretical_and_Practical_Implications_for_Conceptual_Change">Embodied learning</a> incorporates the body and embodied action as part of this learning context, as well.</p>
              <p class="import-Normal">Situated learning contrasts with abstract and decontextualized learning. Sometimes students may memorize formulas, write papers, or do well on standard tests of learning, but they do so without an understanding of the underlying concepts or purpose of the learning, and without transferring their learning to later courses, let alone to the real world.</p>
              <h4><a id="_jce0esju5d7o"></a>Why Does this Matter?</h4>
              <p class="import-Normal">One of the top issues some instructors often mention is a lack of engagement by some students. Some <a class="rId466" href="https://www.cmu.edu/teaching/solveproblem/strat-lackmotivation/lackmotivation-01.html">students seem to lack interest or motivation</a>. Some <a class="rId468" href="https://www.facultyfocus.com/articles/effective-teaching-strategies/teaching-unprepared-students-the-importance-of-increasing-relevance/">students may also be unprepared to learn and succeed in the course</a>. If you follow those links, you&#8217;ll see that one of the best strategies for increasing student motivation and engagement is to increase the relevance and connections of your assignments and activities to the real-world and future learning.</p>
              <p class="import-Normal" style="margin-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt"><em>&#8220;Students who sense a disconnect between what they are learning at college (or in your course) and their future life, as they perceive it, will never engage to the same degree as students who understand the relevant connections between their current learning and their future.</em></p>
              <p class="import-Normal" style="margin-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt"><em>One technique that a teacher can use to increase relevance is to repeatedly ask âSo what?â or âWho cares?â If the teacher struggles to answer these questions from their studentsâ perspectives, there is little chance that the students will be able to make the connection on their own. The task of answering these questions does not necessarily need to rest solely on the teacher, though. An engaging teacher will consistently work with students to construct answers to these two questions based on what they are currently studying.&#8221;</em></p>

              <p class="import-Normal">A significant percentage of college students suffer from stress, anxiety, depression, and other issues affecting their well-being and mental health. Mental health was the most common reason given for college students withdrawing or thinking about withdrawing from college, as a recent <a class="rId485" href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/611093/black-hispanic-students-greatest-risk-leaving-program.aspx?stream=science">State of Higher Education Study</a> found:</p>
              <p class="import-Normal" style="margin-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt"><em>Between 50% and 53% of Black, Hispanic and White students report that emotional stress is the top reason they considered stopping their coursework, followed by 41% to 43% who said it was personal mental health reasons, and 29% to 33% cited cost.</em></p>
              <p class="import-Normal" style="margin-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt"><em>About a quarter of currently enrolled students also mentioned coursework difficulty or a lack of belonging. This lack of belonging may be related to inclusive experiences at school. Twenty-one percent of Black students &#8212; compared with 14% of Hispanic students and 15% of their White peers &#8212; also reported they felt discriminated against frequently or occasionally at school.</em></p>

              <p class="import-Normal">Hopefully, completing one or more of these self-assessments will help you reflect on and evaluate your philosophy of teaching. Your teaching and learning beliefs can have a significant impact on your teaching practices and consequently how students perform in your courses. Similarly, student beliefs about teaching and learning have a significant impact on their own performance. Feel free to survey the mindset of your own students.</p>

Why does this matter? Because a large-scale meta-analysis showed that &#8220;students in classes with traditional lecturing were 1.5 times more likely to fail than were students in classes with active learning&#8221; (<a class="rId548" href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1319030111">Freeman et al., 2014</a>).</p>

              <p class="import-Normal">Here are some tips for starting off your courses:</p>
              <p class="import-Normal"><strong>Course Introduction</strong></p>
              <ul>
                   <li class="import-Normal" style="text-indent: 18pt"><strong>Begin the first day of class with substantial course content to set expectations and demonstrate the value of the material.</strong> This shows students that you are prepared and invested in their learning. You can introduce yourself, distribute the syllabus, give out the first assignment, or begin activities or laboratory experiments.</li>
                   <li class="import-Normal" style="text-indent: 18pt"><strong>Use the first day to clarify the course objectives and your expectations for studentsâ performance.</strong> Students need to understand what will be taught, how the course will be structured, how they will be assessed, and what is expected of them. By the end of the first class, students should understand your expectations, be able to predict the nature of your instruction, and believe you are competent to teach the course.</li>
                   <li class="import-Normal" style="text-indent: 18pt"><strong>Express your confidence in studentsâ ability to succeed in the course if they put in the required effort.</strong> Let students know that you want them to learn, and that you are there to support them.</li>
              </ul>
              <p class="import-Normal"><strong>Instructor Introduction</strong></p>
              <ul>
                   <li class="import-Normal" style="text-indent: 18pt"><strong>Introduce yourself effectively, including your qualifications, teaching style, and research interests related to the course.</strong> Students will want to know your experience level with the course material, how formal/informal you will be, and how available you will be to students. Consider sharing your research interests to establish credibility and make the course more relevant.</li>
                   <li class="import-Normal" style="text-indent: 18pt"><strong>Explain contact procedures, such as office hours and email.</strong> Consider requiring students to meet with you during office hours early in the semester to encourage them to return when they need help.</li>
                   <li class="import-Normal" style="text-indent: 18pt"><strong>Do not share personal information that may undermine your authority or make students question your dedication to the course.</strong> Sharing that you have never taught the course before, or that it is your least favorite to teach, will likely not make a positive impression on students.</li>
              </ul>
              <p class="import-Normal"><strong>Student Introductions and Community Building</strong></p>
              <ul>
                   <li class="import-Normal" style="text-indent: 18pt"><strong>Make an effort to get to know your students. Seek out a different student each day to learn something about them.</strong> You can ask students about their expectations for the course, their experience in the discipline, their goals, or anything else that will help you see them as individuals.</li>
                   <li class="import-Normal" style="text-indent: 18pt"><strong>Facilitate introductions among students to establish a foundation for a collaborative and supportive learning environment.</strong> Ask students about their expectations, prior knowledge of the subject matter, and perceived challenges. You can use icebreakers or have students work in groups to get to know each other. The tone of the class is set on the first day, so encourage a social environment with opportunities for student participation and collaboration.</li>
                   <li class="import-Normal" style="text-indent: 18pt"><strong>Create opportunities for community building in your classroom.</strong> For example:
                   <ul>
                        <li class="import-Normal" style="text-indent: 18pt">Greet students at the door as they enter.</li>
                        <li class="import-Normal" style="text-indent: 18pt">Learn students&#8217; names.</li>
                        <li class="import-Normal" style="text-indent: 18pt">Establish a buddy system so students can contact each other.</li>
                        <li class="import-Normal" style="text-indent: 18pt">Form small groups for students to get to know each other.</li>
                        <li class="import-Normal" style="text-indent: 18pt">Assign a team project and provide time for students to assemble.</li>
                   </ul>
                    </li>
              </ul>
              <p class="import-Normal"><strong>Establishing a Productive Learning Environment</strong></p>
              <ul>
                   <li class="import-Normal" style="text-indent: 18pt"><strong>Clarify learning objectives and expectations for the course.</strong> Highlight learning objectives, assessments, grading criteria, instructional strategies, course policies, and the rationale for these decisions. This will help students understand their role in the learning process and how they can succeed in your course.</li>
                   <li class="import-Normal" style="text-indent: 18pt"><strong>Consider having students take a quiz on the syllabus to reinforce its importance.</strong> This can be done through a learning management system, such as Canvas.</li>
                   <li class="import-Normal" style="text-indent: 18pt"><strong>Help students understand how much time they will need to dedicate to the course.</strong></li>
                   <li class="import-Normal" style="text-indent: 18pt"><strong>Set a productive tone on the first day that communicates the type of classroom dynamic you wish to establish.</strong> For example, if you plan to use group work frequently, begin the semester with a group activity.</li>
              </ul>
              <p class="import-Normal"><strong>Additional Considerations</strong></p>
              <ul>
                   <li class="import-Normal" style="text-indent: 18pt"><strong>Show enthusiasm for the subject matter and a love of learning.</strong></li>
                   <li class="import-Normal" style="text-indent: 18pt"><strong>Start and end class on time to communicate that you respect everyoneâs time.</strong></li>
                   <li class="import-Normal" style="text-indent: 18pt"><strong>Avoid emphasizing rules and penalties on the first day.</strong></li>
                   <li class="import-Normal" style="text-indent: 18pt"><strong>Periodically reinforce the classroom expectations and your confidence in studentsâ ability to succeed throughout the course.</strong></li>
                   <li class="import-Normal" style="text-indent: 18pt"><strong>Be mindful of your nonverbal communication.</strong> Greet students with a smile and make eye contact with them. Students make decisions about you within the first two hours of contact, so approach your classroom with this in mind.</li>
              </ul>

         <div class="online-teaching">
              <p class="import-Normal">See our <a class="rId580" href="https://pressbooks.hccfl.edu/quality/">annotated guide to high quality standards for online courses</a> for tips and resources for designing and facilitating effective online courses that meet our state quality standards.</p>
              <p class="import-Normal">Designing an effective online course begins with thoughtful organization and clarity. A well-structured layout is essential; your course should be easy to navigate, with a logical format that aligns topics and subtopics seamlessly. To avoid overwhelming students, break down the content into manageable sections. Additionally, provide clear, specific, and measurable learning objectives, ensuring that assessments and learning activities align with these objectives. This structured approach will help students understand what is expected of them and how they can achieve their learning goals.</p>
              <p class="import-Normal">Orientation and managing expectations are critical components of an effective online course. Offer a detailed orientation that explains the course&#8217;s purpose, format, and how students can get started. Clearly outline your expectations for student participation, performance, and interaction. Include a comprehensive grading plan and assessment criteria to give students a clear understanding of how their performance will be evaluated. Setting these expectations early on will help students stay on track and understand the requirements for success.</p>
              <p class="import-Normal">Authentic learning experiences are key to engaging students in an online environment. Incorporate real-world applications to make learning relevant and meaningful. Use accessible and interactive content, preferably Open Educational Resources (OER), to support critical reflection and the application of knowledge to real-world scenarios. Providing such engaging content helps students connect theoretical concepts with practical applications, enhancing their overall learning experience.</p>
              <p class="import-Normal">Interaction and support play vital roles in online education. As an instructor, your active participation in online discussions shows your interest in student learning and encourages engagement. Provide timely and detailed feedback on assessments and inquiries to guide students through their learning journey. Facilitate discussions and learning activities by expanding studentsâ thoughts and knowledge with new prompts and additional content. This active involvement helps create a dynamic learning environment where students feel supported and motivated.</p>
              <p class="import-Normal">Peer interaction is equally important. Promote frequent and meaningful collaborative activities to encourage peer involvement. Use available technologies to provide opportunities for students to learn from one another. Collaborative work not only enhances learning but also helps build a sense of community among students, which is often challenging in an online setting.</p>
              <p class="import-Normal">Reducing barriers to learning is essential for student success. Offer clear explanations, descriptions, standards, requirements, guidelines, and context for all activities and assessments. Providing this level of clarity helps students understand what is expected of them and how to meet those expectations effectively. This supportive approach can significantly reduce the barriers to learning and improve student outcomes.</p>
              <p class="import-Normal">Richness in content enhances the learning experience. Provide materials that are current, comprehensive, and diverse. Identify important topics and offer the necessary context to facilitate a deeper understanding. Rich and varied content keeps students engaged and encourages them to explore the subject matter more thoroughly.</p>
              <p class="import-Normal">Active learning is crucial for maintaining student engagement. Promote frequent peer involvement and collaborative work to foster an active learning environment. Use interactive tools and media to keep students engaged and facilitate active participation. This approach not only makes learning more enjoyable but also helps students retain information better.</p>
              <p class="import-Normal">Continuous improvement is a hallmark of effective online teaching. Regularly collect and analyze student feedback to identify areas for improvement. Use this feedback to make iterative enhancements to your course design and facilitation strategies. Staying updated with the latest online teaching practices and technologies through ongoing professional development is also essential. This commitment to continuous improvement ensures that your course remains relevant and effective in meeting the needs of your students.</p>
              <p class="import-Normal">By following these guidelines, college instructors can create an online learning environment that is structured, engaging, and supportive, ultimately enhancing student outcomes and satisfaction.</p>

              <p class="import-Normal">As discussed earlier, students donât remember or transfer much of what theyâve learned after their courses are over. Father Guido Sarducci joked about this in his <a class="rId571" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kO8x8eoU3L4">Five Minute University</a> comedy routine.</p>
              <p class="import-Normal">One way to ameliorate this is to focus your course design on the main âbig ideasâ or âbig questionsâ that you want them to remember and understand after your course is over. Start with the end goals you have for student learning and work backward from there to the assessments of their learning and understanding and finally to the activities and materials that youâll incorporate into your course. This is known as <a class="rId572" href="https://cft.vanderbilt.edu/guides-sub-pages/understanding-by-design/">backward design</a>.</p>
              <p class="import-Normal" style="text-align: center"><a class="rId573" href="https://cft.vanderbilt.edu/guides-sub-pages/understanding-by-design/"><img src="http://pressbooks.hccfl.edu/teaching/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2024/07/image12.png" alt="image" width="469.4px" height="388.157690288714px" /></a></p>
              <h3><a id="_nrvk9tj3seh6"></a>Initial Design Phase: Building Strong Primary Components</h3>
              <p class="import-Normal">When embarking on course design, the first step involves understanding various situational factors. Consider the specific context of your course, such as the class size, course level (whether lower division, upper division, or graduate), delivery method (in-person, online, or hybrid), and the physical learning environment. Recognize the expectations placed on your course by students, your department, and the broader profession.</p>
              <p class="import-Normal">Defining clear and meaningful learning goals is crucial. Move beyond a content-centered approach and adopt a learning-centered mindset. Reflect on what you want students to retain years after completing your course. Dee Finkâs Taxonomy of Significant Learning can guide this process, emphasizing foundational knowledge, application, integration, human dimension, caring, and learning how to learn.</p>
              <p class="import-Normal">Design your assessments to provide educative feedback, which enhances the quality of learning rather than simply assigning grades. Implement forward-looking assessments that place students in real-life contexts, ensuring that the criteria and standards for high-quality work are clear. Incorporate opportunities for self-assessment and provide feedback that is frequent, immediate, discriminating, and empathetic (FIDeLity feedback).</p>
              <p class="import-Normal">Incorporating active learning is essential for student engagement. Move beyond traditional lectures and discussions to involve students in activities that require them to do and think about their actions, such as debates, simulations, problem-solving, and case studies. Adopt a holistic view of active learning that combines information and ideas with experiential learning and reflective dialogue.</p>
              <h3><a id="_vmal3639ra2k"></a>Intermediate Design Phase: Assembling Components into a Coherent Whole</h3>
              <p class="import-Normal">Creating a cohesive course structure is vital. Develop a thematic structure that aligns all course components, ensuring that learning goals, assessments, and teaching activities support each other. Your instructional strategy should build a sequence of learning activities that reinforce these goals, using a mix of direct and indirect learning activities to maintain engagement and deepen understanding.</p>
              <h3><a id="_ai47lb6e2jd0"></a>Final Design Phase: Completing Important Remaining Tasks</h3>
              <p class="import-Normal">Establish a clear and fair grading system that accurately reflects your learning goals and assessment criteria. Anticipate potential issues and plan strategies to address them, ensuring smooth course delivery. Communicate your course plan, expectations, and goals clearly to students through a well-constructed syllabus, which should serve as a comprehensive guide outlining the course structure, schedule, policies, and available resources.</p>
              <p class="import-Normal">Plan for ongoing evaluation of your course and teaching methods. Seek feedback from students and colleagues to identify areas for improvement, continuously refining your approach to enhance learning outcomes.</p>
              <p class="import-Normal">By following these strategies, college instructors can design and deliver courses that engage students and foster significant learning experiences that extend well beyond the classroom.</p>

         <p>Evidence-based teaching refers to teaching strategies for which there have been research studies indicating their effectiveness at improving student learning, engagement, attitudes, equity, or other factors related to academic success.</p>
         <p>There are various types of strategies that work in different contexts and time scales, as depicted in the table below. Most are built upon educational and psychological concepts like active learning, collaborative learning, metacognition, belonging, self-efficacy, feedback, or self-determination theory.</p>
         <p>This <a href="https://canvas.instructure.com/courses/3168265">Canvas resource</a> and <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1keBSTUhY-Xt8z_KK0QRG4-5ftSVvzGIiaDKoEVa1QYQ/edit?usp=sharing">handout</a> have examples of some evidence-based strategies that can be implemented in your courses.</p>

         </header>
         <p>There have long been calls for using&nbsp;<a href="#chapter-ebt">evidence-based teaching techniques</a> and technologies in the classroom to improve student success.&nbsp; For example the 2012 â<a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/pcast-engage-to-excel-final_2-25-12.pdf">Engage to Excel</a>â report by the Presidential Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST) notes that&nbsp;âClassroom approaches that engage students in âactive learningâ improve retention of information and critical thinking skills.â</p>
         <p>Sometimes it may seem risky to try something new or nontraditional in your class, however, partly because of the uncertainty about how students may react. And even when you are not trying anything new at all, some students may passively or even actively show signs of resistance or dissatisfaction, for various reasons.</p>
         <p>There are actually many potential <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40594-017-0062-7">barriers to the adoption of evidence-based teaching techniques</a>&nbsp;and technologies, such as: lack of time, insufficient resources or support, and, the topic of this post, the possibility of student resistance, which in turn might negatively impact student satisfaction and ratings.</p>
         <p>How can we design and facilitate our courses in order to anticipate and reduce the potential for student resistance?&nbsp; There are several techniques one may employ, many of which are backed by research.&nbsp; First, however, letâs look at the causes and types of student resistance, and then weâll look at strategies for addressing it.</p>
         <h2>What is Student Resistance?</h2>
         <p>The editors of a recent book,&nbsp;<em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Why-Students-Resist-Learning-Understanding-ebook/dp/B01MSMK7UH">Why Students Resist Learning</a></em>, define student resistance like so:</p>
         <blockquote>
              <p><em>Student resistance is an outcome, a motivational state in which students reject learning opportunities due to systemic factors.</em></p>
         </blockquote>
         <p>The kinds of systemic factors that may influence resistance are presented in the bookâs diagram model of student resistance:</p>

         <h3>Examples of Student Resistance</h3>
         <p>Several examples of student resistance are listed in the book. They divide the examples by the type of the resistance (passive or active) and the motivation for the resistance (asserting autonomy or self-preservation):</p>

         <h3>Resistance to Group Work</h3>
         <p>Group work, group projects, group presentations have long been a special source of complaints by students.&nbsp; Here are some common ones from the article â<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228432321_Group_Work_Can_Be_Gratifying_Understanding_Overcoming_Resistance_to_Cooperative_Learning">Group Work Can Be Gratifying: Understanding &amp; Overcoming Resistance to Cooperative Learning</a>â:</p>
         <ul>
              <li>âIâve had bad experiences with group work. Why donât you just lecture?â</li>
              <li>âI donât want to rely on strangers. Why canât I form a group with my friends?â</li>
              <li>âWe waste a lot of time in meetings. No one wants to take responsibility.â</li>
              <li>âI donât know what we are supposed to do or why we are doing it.â</li>
              <li>âI have to do all the work and donât get the credit. I feel exploited.â</li>
              <li>âThe group work just feels like busy work to me. Whatâs the point?â</li>
              <li>âI worked harder than other people in my group but I got the same grade. Thatâs unfair.â</li>
         </ul>
         <p>If you are using student groups in your courses, consider some of these resources for improving their effectiveness:</p>
         <ul>
              <li><a href="https://csc151.cs.grinnell.edu/files/OakleyHitchhikers2004.pdf">Turning Student Groups into Effective Teams</a> â see especially the forms and notes at the end of the article</li>
              <li>Consider employing <a href="http://www.teambasedlearning.org/">Team-based Learning</a> â a well established evidence-based teaching technique.&nbsp; They recently also put out a <a href="http://www.teambasedlearning.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Off-to-On_OnlineTBL_WhitePaper_ClarkEtal2018_V3.pdf">white paper on best practices for online team-based learning</a>.</li>
         </ul>
         <h3>Measuring Student Resistance</h3>
         <p>There has recently been some new research on measuring student resistance that began with the creation of the <a href="https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/136692/jee20162.pdf?sequence=2&amp;isAllowed=y">Student Response to Instructional Practices Survey (StRIP)</a>, which includes items related to student resistance:</p>
         <ul>
              <li>I did not actually participate in the activity.</li>
              <li>I gave the activity minimal effort.</li>
              <li>I distracted my peers during the activity.</li>
              <li>I pretended to participate in the activity.</li>
              <li>I surfed the internet, social media, or did something else instead of doing the activity.</li>
              <li>I rushed through the activity.</li>
         </ul>
         <h3>Other Examples of Student Resistance?</h3>
         <p>Are there other examples not listed above?&nbsp; Is <a href="https://www.ai.niu.edu/academic-integrity/index.shtml">plagiarism</a> a form of student resistance?&nbsp; <a href="https://kuscholarworks.ku.edu/handle/1808/11426">Copying homework problems</a>?</p>
         <h3>How Prevalent is Student Resistance?</h3>
         <p>The good news is that student resistance is not as widespread as you may think.&nbsp;&nbsp;Several studies and surveys have shown that on average, most students like and prefer when instructors adopt active learning and other innovative teaching strategies and tools (see, e.g., the article â<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/319043554_Students'_Expectations_Types_of_Instruction_and_Instructor_Strategies_Predicting_Student_Response_to_Active_Learning">Studentsâ Expectations, Types of Instruction, and Instructor Strategies Predicting Student Response to Active Learning</a>â).</p>
         <p>So it is not as bad a problem as we might think. However, there is still a likelihood of student resistance, especially when you first adopt a new technique. This may be why, for example, some instructors may abandon a new technique after the first semester of trying it.</p>
         <h2>Strategies for Addressing Student Resistance</h2>
         <p>Richard Felder and Rebecca Brent, authors of the book <a href="https://educationdesignsinc.com/book/"><em>Teaching and Learning STEM: A Practical Guide</em></a>, identify <a href="https://educationdesignsinc.com/resistance/">Eight Ways to Defuse Student Resistance</a>, including:</p>
         <ul>
              <li>Ease into new teaching techniques or technologies.&nbsp; For example, if you are trying out flipping the classroom, try it out one week at first before switching the whole course to the technique.</li>
              <li>Explain what you are doing, why you are doing it, and what the benefits are to the students.&nbsp; Iâll share some example explanations below.</li>
              <li>Survey your students about their experiences to get their feedback.&nbsp; Iâll share some example techniques for collecting student feedback below, as well.</li>
         </ul>
         <p>In recent research on <a href="https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/142791/40594_2018_Article_102.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y">strategies to mitigate student resistance to active learning</a>&nbsp;(Tharayil et al., 2018), both explanation strategies and facilitation strategies have been identified:</p>
         <h3>Explanation Strategies</h3>
         <ul>
              <li>Providing students with a rationale for using active learning in the classroom by explaining how the activities relate to their learning, connecting the activities with course topics, discussing their relevance to industry</li>
              <li>Communicating overall course expectations for student participation at the beginning of the semester</li>
              <li>Providing explicit instructions about what students are expected to do for a specific active learning exercise</li>
         </ul>
         <h3>Facilitation Strategies</h3>
         <ul>
              <li>Establishing verbal or non-verbal cues such as setting a tone for risk taking, caring about studentsâ success, encouraging responses by using uncomfortable silences, etc.</li>
              <li>Confronting students who are not participating in activities by physically approaching them, calling on them during more structured lecture, etc.</li>
              <li>Using points or grades to encourage participation</li>
              <li>Walking around the room during active learning instruction</li>
              <li>Encouraging students to provide feedback about an in-class activity</li>
              <li>Prompting students to ask questions about an activity during that activity</li>
              <li>Establishing an âactive learningâ routine by having a standard type of âbell work,â</li>
              <li>Creating student groups, reframing tasks, etc</li>
              <li>Use incremental activities: giving hints, decomposing a problem into parts,â¦</li>
         </ul>
         <p>Some more concrete details about strategies are listed below.</p>
         <h3>1. Framing: Explaining to Your Students</h3>
         <p>Here are some examples of instructors explaining to their students the rationale for using some new teaching technique or technology:</p>
         <div class="jetpack-video-wrapper">
              <p class="import-Normal"><a class="rId656" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFzz5nOywbg">Realistic Preview of Online Learning</a></p>

         </div>
         <p>See the <a href="https://www.physport.org/recommendations/Entry.cfm?T=productive%20engagement">Physport series on productively engaging students in active learning</a> for more resources and examples related to framing.</p>
         <h3>2. Student Testimonials</h3>
         <p>Instead of you trying to explain the rationale, have former students explain what it takes to succeed in your course.</p>
         <p>This is a technique that may not only help reduce potential student anxiety and resistance, but it also has been shown in studies to improve studentsâ sense of belonging, which in turn reduces equity gaps, including for&nbsp;<a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/355/6322/251">international students</a> and <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/331/6023/1447">minority students</a>.</p>
         <h4>2a. Video Testimonials</h4>
         <p>You can create or have your students create video testimonials.&nbsp; Here is a â<a href="https://olc-conferences-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/slides/OLC%20Presentation_1.pdf">realistic job preview</a>â video by and for students taking courses online:</p>
         <div class="jetpack-video-wrapper">
              <a class="rId664" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFzz5nOywbg">Realistic Preview of Online Learning</a>
         </div>
         <p>Here also is a <a href="https://vimeo.com/49474719">video of students in first year engineering at Ohio State</a>.</p>
         <h4>2b. Text and Letter Testimonials</h4>
         <p>You can have your students write <a href="http://bit.ly/letterstofreshmen2015">letters of advice to next yearâs students</a> at the end of a semester.</p>
         <p>In a research article on â<a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/suppl/2017/01/23/355.6322.251.DC1">Closing global achievement gaps in MOOCs</a>,â students read testimonials, such as this one:</p>
         <blockquote>
              <p><em>âWhen I first started the course, I worried that I was different from the other students. Everyone else seemed so certain it was the right level for them and were so happy to take it. But I wasnât sure I fit in â if I would make friends, if people would respect me. Several days after I started, I came to realize that almost everyone who takes the course feels uncertain at first about whether they fit in. Itâs something everyone goes through. Now it seems ironic â everybody feels different at first, when really weâre all going through the same things.â</em></p>
         </blockquote>
         <h4>2c. Ask Students to Reflect on the Explanation/Testimonials â Not Just Watch or Read</h4>
         <p>If you just have students passively watch or read an explanation or testimonial, it may have no impact on improving their success in the course.&nbsp;Here is a sample writing activity students did after reading the aforementioned student testimonial:</p>
         <blockquote>
              <p><em>Now consider the strategies and insights for how to learn best that you just read. What are your own strategies and insights about how to learn best? And, how are they similar or different to the ones that you just heard about from other students? Please write at least a paragraph. Focus on your thoughts and feelings, and donât worry about spelling, grammar, or how well written it is.</em></p>
         </blockquote>
         <h4>2d. Generating / Creating Student Testimonials</h4>
         <p>Youâll also have to think about how you will collect and present student testimonials. Will you ask former students to visit your class and speak with the current students?&nbsp; Or create a video or collect written testimonials?&nbsp; Here is how student testimonials were collected in the aforementioned article:</p>
         <blockquote>
              <p><em>New students really appreciate hearing directly from students who already have some experience with learning in an online course. To give the new incoming learners a chance to hear directly from somewhat more experienced learners, we would like you to write a note to an incoming learner about your experience and what youâve learned so far. Write about how they may feel unsure at first of their belonging in the online course but ultimately come to feel that they belong. We will give your note to a student who enrolls in the course for similar reasons as yourself, so you can imagine it is a student like you. We know it can be difficult to write that way, but we believe it will be particularly meaningful for new learners if they feel as though a more experienced learner is speaking directly to them.</em></p>
         </blockquote>
         <p>The remaining strategies for addressing student resistance are related to soliciting feedback from your students about your teaching and the course.&nbsp; By getting their feedback early and throughout the semester, you can make adjustments that will help improve student satisfaction and learning and reduce student resistance, as opposed to waiting for the traditional end of course survey when it is too late to make changes for those students.</p>
         <h3>3. Midterm Student Feedback</h3>
         <p>Midterm Student Feedback (MSF) involves collecting feedback from students near the start or middle of a course in order to give the instructor an opportunity to make adjustments and improvements. &nbsp;Usually an outside consultant collects the feedback and provides guidance for the instructor on translating the feedback into positive changes in the course. The entire process is confidential to the instructor and anonymous for the students.</p>
         <p>You can also survey students yourself. See this <a href="https://www.physport.org/recommendations/files/Stop-Go-Change-Evals.pdf">Stop-Go-Change activity</a>.</p>
         <p>Here are some different examples of questions that you might ask of your students:</p>
         <ul>
              <li>via <a href="https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED217954">Clark &amp; Redmond (1982)</a>
              <ul>
                   <li>What do you like about the course?</li>
                   <li>What do you think needs improvement?</li>
                   <li>What suggestions do you have for bringing about those improvements?</li>
              </ul>
               </li>
              <li>via Simmons College and others
              <ul>
                   <li>What do you like most about this course and/or the instructorâs teaching of it?</li>
                   <li>What about this course and/or the instructorâs teaching of it needs change or improvement?</li>
                   <li>What suggestions can you offer that would help make this course a better learning experience for you?</li>
              </ul>
               </li>
              <li>via U. Michigan
              <ul>
                   <li>What are the major strengths in this course?</li>
                   <li>What changes could be made in the course to assist you in learning?</li>
              </ul>
               </li>
         </ul>
         <p>See the <a href="https://bit.ly/msfguidebook">MSF Guidebook</a> for more examples and details.</p>
         <h3>4. Minute Papers, Exit Tickets</h3>
         <p>You can also collect feedback from students yourself by asking students to answer questions at the end of class (exit ticket) or the end of an assignment or module.&nbsp; Here are some examples of the types of questions you might be interested in asking.</p>
         <ul>
              <li>What was the most important point of the class?</li>
              <li>What question remains unanswered in your mind?</li>
              <li>What question from this class might appear on the next quiz/test?</li>
              <li>What was the muddiest point of the class?</li>
              <li>What was the main concept illustrated by the in-class demonstration/experiment?</li>
         </ul>
         <p>Here are some of the types of questions you might want to ask when your students turn in a paper assignment:</p>
         <ul>
              <li>Paper 1: Iâm most satisfied with . . . Iâm least satisfied with . . . Iâm having problems with . . .</li>
              <li>Paper 2: In writing this essay, what did you learn that surprised you? When editing your paper, what were you unsure about?</li>
              <li>Paper 3: Point out specific places in your argument at which you were aware of accommodating your audience (their knowledge or attitudes). Point out places in which you used sentences for rhetorical effect.</li>
              <li>Paper 4: Why did you choose this particular arrangement?<br />
               What would you do differently if you had more time?</li>
         </ul>
         <p>See&nbsp;<a href="https://bit.ly/minutepapers">bit.ly/minutepapers</a> for a longer list of potential questions.</p>
         <p>How will you collect feedback from students to improve upon what you are doing in your courses?&nbsp; Doing so may also help reduce student resistance, as well.</p>

              <p class="import-Normal">Below are some tips and best practices for helping ensure academic integrity on your exams, including alternatives to proctored exams.</p>
              <h3><a id="_sap46w65pmaw"></a>Definition of Academic Integrity</h3>
              <p class="import-Normal">From the <a class="rId726" href="https://libguides.hccfl.edu/c.php?g=472822&amp;p=3235337">Ybor City Campus Learning Council</a>:</p>
              <p class="import-Normal" style="margin-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt"><em>Students who demonstrate academic integrity use their own thoughts and efforts<br style="clear: both" />
              when performing academic work and acknowledge any contributions or<br style="clear: both" />
              collaboration. Academic integrity is critical to Hillsborough Community Collegeâs<br style="clear: both" />
              mission, vision, and values, and it is the responsibility of all faculty, staff, and<br style="clear: both" />
              students of the college. Each person must consciously choose to uphold this<br style="clear: both" />
              important and vital responsibility.</em></p>
              <h3><a id="_emka36yv6djq"></a>Academic Integrity in Practice</h3>
              <p class="import-Normal">Actively practicing the principles of academic honesty can be accomplished in<br style="clear: both" />
              many ways. Below is a list of several examples of academic integrity in practice.</p>
              <ul>
                   <li class="import-Normal" style="text-indent: 18pt">Submit ONLY work based on your own understanding of the<br style="clear: both" />
                   materials/sources authorized by your instructor AND on your own efforts in<br style="clear: both" />
                   gathering information used to complete an assignment.</li>
                   <li class="import-Normal" style="text-indent: 18pt">Credit any sources used, and be knowledgeable of the definition of<br style="clear: both" />
                   plagiarism so that you may avoid it. Plagiarism is intentionally or<br style="clear: both" />
                   unintentionally using someone elseâs words, ideas, phrases, sentences,<br style="clear: both" />
                   pictures, or other original material whether published or unpublished in print<br style="clear: both" />
                   or online without acknowledging its source. Examples of plagiarism include,<br style="clear: both" />
                   but are not limited to: acquiring or buying a term paper or essay and<br style="clear: both" />
                   submitting it as your own; cutting and pasting sentences from a website, or<br style="clear: both" />
                   paraphrasing somebody elseâs ideas, theories or opinions without<br style="clear: both" />
                   acknowledging the original author or creator of the work. Plagiarism also<br style="clear: both" />
                   applies to other forms of creative expression such as music, media, and<br style="clear: both" />
                   visual arts. One can also self-plagiarize by submitting the same or<br style="clear: both" />
                   substantially similar assignment more than once.</li>
                   <li class="import-Normal" style="text-indent: 18pt">Protect the integrity of your assignments, work and/or exams by not sharing<br style="clear: both" />
                   or allowing others to copy your work.</li>
                   <li class="import-Normal" style="text-indent: 18pt">Use only permissible materials to prepare and complete work. For example,<br style="clear: both" />
                   avoid the use of an unauthorized copy of an exam.</li>
                   <li class="import-Normal" style="text-indent: 18pt">Obtain a clear understanding from instructors about collaborating with<br style="clear: both" />
                   others. This understanding will give you a set of rules and expectations to<br style="clear: both" />
                   follow when working with classmates to complete group assignments.</li>
                   <li class="import-Normal" style="text-indent: 18pt">Provide personal information as required by the college that is accurate and<br style="clear: both" />
                   true to the best of your knowledge.</li>
                   <li class="import-Normal" style="text-indent: 18pt">Report violations of academic honesty to your supervisor or dean.</li>
              </ul>
              <h3><a id="_9z5z3sctqe44"></a>Benefits of Academic Integrity</h3>
              <p class="import-Normal">Maintaining academic integrity has college-wide and personal benefits. Specifically,<br style="clear: both" />
              practicing academic integrity:</p>
              <ul>
                   <li class="import-Normal" style="text-indent: 18pt">protects the reputation of the college. Earning a degree from an institution<br style="clear: both" />
                   recognized as having strong academic values and principles can significantly<br style="clear: both" />
                   influence the employability of its students in a positive manner. Reputation<br style="clear: both" />
                   can also impact the support the college receives from local, state, and federal<br style="clear: both" />
                   Entities.</li>
                   <li class="import-Normal" style="text-indent: 18pt">supports the collegeâs mission to deliver opportunities that empower<br style="clear: both" />
                   students to achieve their educational goals and become contributing members<br style="clear: both" />
                   of the local community and a global society. In other words, the practice of<br style="clear: both" />
                   academic honesty encourages students to be responsible for their own<br style="clear: both" />
                   learning and promotes a sense of pride in oneâs own accomplishments which<br style="clear: both" />
                   in turn can help students in attaining personal and career aspirations.</li>
                   <li class="import-Normal" style="text-indent: 18pt">ensures fairness for all students. Earned grades accurately reflect the effort<br style="clear: both" />
                   put forth by each student and is not a measure of someone elseâs work.</li>
                   <li class="import-Normal" style="text-indent: 18pt">promotes the practice of academic honesty as it provides examples as well as<br style="clear: both" />
                   sets a standard for others to follow.</li>
              </ul>
              <h3><a id="_gu77vlwx0pot"></a>Consequences of Academic Dishonesty</h3>
              <p class="import-Normal">Students who engage in academic dishonesty, including plagiarism, collusion,<br style="clear: both" />
              cheating, or other dishonest behavior, may be subject to disciplinary action, up to<br style="clear: both" />
              and including expulsion from the College.</p>
              <h3><a id="_xfft9ksh3dpz"></a>Alternatives to Timed, Proctored Exams</h3>
              <p class="import-Normal">Consider giving your students take-home style open book exams or writing assignments or projects. You can use <a class="rId728" href="https://help.turnitin.com/integrity/instructor/canvas.htm">TurnItIn</a> if you wish to check any submitted papers for plagiarism.

              <h3><a id="_ml2dbtorl7mw"></a>Best Practices with Timed, Proctored Exams</h3>
              <h4><a id="_kzqo9087hamg"></a>Before the Exam</h4>
              <ul>
                   <li class="import-Normal" style="text-indent: 18pt">Include your expectations and the academic integrity policy in your syllabus, as well as discussing this early on with your students during class. You might share this data on the <a class="rId740" href="https://kuscholarworks.ku.edu/handle/1808/11426">negative impact of homework copying</a>, for example.</li>
                   <li class="import-Normal" style="text-indent: 18pt">Explore some of the <a class="rId742" href="https://www.cmu.edu/teaching/solveproblem/strat-cheating/">reasons why students might cheat on your exam</a>.</li>
                   <li class="import-Normal" style="text-indent: 18pt">For multi-section courses, use common exams and grading systems. See <a class="rId744" href="#chapter-coordination">Course Coordination</a> for best practices.</li>
                   <li class="import-Normal" style="text-indent: 18pt">Change the questions on your exams each semester, as students may copy or share questions with other students.</li>
                   <li class="import-Normal" style="text-indent: 18pt">If using a Canvas quiz for the exam, <a class="rId746" href="https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Instructor-Guide/What-options-can-I-set-in-a-quiz/ta-p/683">shuffle the answers</a>, <a class="rId748" href="https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Instructor-Guide/How-do-I-create-a-quiz-with-a-question-group-to-randomize-quiz/ta-p/1032">create question groups</a>, and use <a class="rId750" href="https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Instructor-Guide/How-do-I-create-a-Formula-quiz-question-with-a-single-variable/ta-p/920">formula questions</a> to reduce the chance of copying answers.</li>
                   <li class="import-Normal" style="text-indent: 18pt">As a general rule of thumb, if you can google the answer (or use an app like Photomath to solve a math problem), it shouldnât be on the exam.</li>
                   <li class="import-Normal" style="text-indent: 18pt">Include higher order questions on your exams, beyond just memorization and âplug and chugâ type questions.</li>
                   <li class="import-Normal" style="text-indent: 18pt">Help students prepare for the exam by discussing the test beforehand and providing practice questions and/or a study guide. <a class="rId752" href="https://www.asee.org/public/conferences/140/papers/26270/view">Practice exams can improve student performance and retention</a>.</li>
                   <li class="import-Normal" style="text-indent: 18pt">Have students work in pairs or small groups on practice problems during class instead of only watching you solve problems or working on them solo from home.</li>
                   <li class="import-Normal" style="text-indent: 18pt">Consider doing exercises with your students to <a class="rId754" href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0098628318816182">reduce their test anxiety</a> and stress. <a class="rId756" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6310416/">Active learning exercises during class can not only improve student learning but reduce test anxiety</a>.</li>
                   <li class="import-Normal" style="text-indent: 18pt">Include <a class="rId758" href="https://www.cmu.edu/teaching/designteach/teach/examwrappers/">exam wrapper questions</a> on your exam, such as how many hours did they study for the exam or what grade they predict. This also gives you something to discuss with individual students afterward who may have struggled on your exam.</li>
              </ul>
              <h4><a id="_gzfwq8zbs9tc"></a>During the Exam</h4>
              <ul>
                   <li class="import-Normal" style="text-indent: 18pt">Conduct the exam in-class on paper if possible. Walk around the room during the exam and sit students by number to reduce the chances of cheating.</li>
                   <li class="import-Normal" style="text-indent: 18pt">If the exam is remotely proctored, set the exam to record the webcam and screen and instruct your students to point the webcam at their work area, as well as signing their handwritten work and holding it up to the webcam before scanning it in and submitting it. If students do not need to scan and submit a PDF file (all the questions are completed on-screen in Canvas), you can turn on additional options to reduce the chances of cheating.</li>
                   <li class="import-Normal" style="text-indent: 18pt">Consider trying the <a class="rId760" href="http://www.cwsei.ubc.ca/resources/files/Two-stage_Exams.pdf">two-stage exam technique</a>. Students take a quiz or exam first individually, and then a second time in a group. This can prevent struggling students from falling further and further behind, since they can learn from each other the things they missed in the first stage. And you donât have to spend so much time reviewing the exam yourself. Hereâs a <a class="rId762" href="http://blogs.ubc.ca/wpvc/two-stage-exams/">video</a> of it in action, as well as more <a class="rId764" href="https://www.eoas.ubc.ca/research/cwsei/eossei-times/EOSSEITimes_6.09-LogisticsOfTwoStageExams.pdf">tips for success</a>.</li>

              <h4><a id="_owy898kccnmk"></a>How to Accommodate Students Who Need Extra Time</h4>
              <p class="import-Normal">There are 2 steps to giving one or more students extra time:</p>
              <ul>
                   <li class="import-Normal" style="text-indent: 18pt">After the quiz is published, click the âModerate this Quizâ link on the top right, find the row with the student who needs extra time, click the pencil icon on the far right, and set the extra time. See: <a class="rId770" href="https://community.canvaslms.com/docs/DOC-13053-4152276279">Once I publish a timed quiz, how can I give my students extra time?</a></li>
                   <li class="import-Normal" style="text-indent: 18pt">Secondly, there is an issue â when the âUntil Dateâ and time for the quiz is reached, all quizzes not yet completed will be automatically submitted, <em>even for those students you gave extra time</em>. So that means you have to edit the quiz, scroll to the bottom, click the Add button, enter the studentâs name, and give that student their own due date, available from date, and extended Until Date. See: <a class="rId772" href="https://community.canvaslms.com/docs/DOC-10038-4152101240">How do I assign a quiz to an individual student?</a></li>
              </ul>
              <h4><a id="_celivkidhvzj"></a>Give Your Students a Practice Proctored Exam First</h4>
              <p class="import-Normal">We recommend you have your students try completing a practice proctored exam before the first real one, so that they can test that everything works and get used to the experience.</p>
              <h4><a id="_u5n0x08rz6zc"></a>Sending an Announcement to Your Students with Guidance for the Proctored Exam</h4>
              <p class="import-Normal">For any instructions for your exam, you should send an announcement to your students with that information, as the instructions inside the exam will not be visible until after the exam has started.</p>
              <p class="import-Normal">Refer your students to support resources if they need help using the proctoring tool.</p>
              <p class="import-Normal">In your message to students, tell them to contact you immediately if they donât have a webcam or for whatever reason cannot complete the proctored exam.</p>
              <h4><a id="_cmwzhj67weo0"></a>Troubleshooting Student Issues During the Exam</h4>
              <p class="import-Normal">Please stay by your email during the proctored exam so that you can quickly respond to any issues that may arise.</p>
              <p class="import-Normal">In your guidance for students, show students how to contact support, but for some issues, only you can help. An example is if a student just cannot get the proctoring tool to work despite using Chrome and installing the extension, or a student finding out their webcam is not working and requesting an access code to bypass the tool.</p>

         <div class="student-evaluations-of-teaching">
              <p class="import-Normal">Near the end of the semester, students complete a survey with their feedback on your courses. The results of the survey are made available to you after the semester has ended and grades have been submitted. See the <a class="rId774" href="https://hccfl.sharepoint.com/sites/ir">Institutional Research Sharepoint site</a> for details about the <a class="rId775" href="https://hccfl.sharepoint.com/sites/ir/Shared%20Documents/surveys/Student-Evaluations-of-Faculty-SURVEY.pdf">survey</a> and process used at HCC.</p>
              <p class="import-Normal">Below are tips and best practices for effectively administering and interpreting end-of-semester student evaluations of teaching.</p>
              <h3><a id="_8pze4d6ki9lq"></a>Improving Student Response Rates for Online End of Course Surveys</h3>
              <p class="import-Normal">One difficulty with online end of course surveys is getting your students to actually complete the survey. Below are some tips for improving response rates.</p>
              <ul>
                   <li class="import-Normal" style="text-indent: 18pt">Encourage and remind students to complete the end of course evaluation multiple times. Send out emails to students with the link to the online evaluation form, and remind them at the end of class to fill out the survey. You can even show them on the projector screen how to complete the survey. Add the evaluation dates to your syllabus and course calendar.</li>
                   <li class="import-Normal" style="text-indent: 18pt">Emphasize to your students that the survey is completely anonymous, and that you will not see their responses until after the final grades are submitted.</li>
                   <li class="import-Normal" style="text-indent: 18pt">Explain why the survey is important, and how you will use the data to make improvements to the course. Tell them what kind of feedback you are looking for. If you have any previous examples of changes you made in response to student feedback, you might share that with the students. You can also tell students that the university assessment office and department chairs use the data, too, for example for promotion and tenure decisions.</li>
                   <li class="import-Normal" style="text-indent: 18pt">To dramatically increase the percentage of students who complete the survey, give them time during class to do it. Ask students to bring laptops or smartphones to class and give them time during the last 15 minutes of class to complete the survey. It is best if you even leave the classroom during this time so that they feel more comfortable providing their responses, and again assure them that the survey is anonymous and you cannot see the responses until after the semester is over.</li>
                   <li class="import-Normal" style="text-indent: 18pt">An alternative way to dramatically increase participation is to provide incentives or even credit for students to complete the survey, such as bonus points. You should be careful not to design the incentive in a way that punishes students who choose not to complete the survey, however.</li>
              </ul>
              <h3><a id="_z69u407c38y3"></a>Interpreting Student Evaluations of Teaching</h3>
              <p class="import-Normal">You got your students to complete the survey, now what? How do I interpret their responses? What use is this data?</p>
              <ul>
                   <li class="import-Normal" style="text-indent: 18pt">It can be hard to read criticisms of your teaching, just as it is hard to read criticisms of your research papers, or to hear criticisms in general! Take it with a grain of salt. If a student says something you think is mean or unfair, just <a class="rId777" href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2014/09/11/professors_reading_their_rate_my_professor_ratings_funny_but_a_bad_idea.html">let it go</a>. Every instructor receives negative feedback from time to time. See also <a class="rId778" href="http://www.facultyfocus.com/articles/faculty-evaluation/cruel-student-comments-seven-ways-soothe-sting/">Cruel Student Comments: Seven Ways to Soothe the Sting</a>.</li>
                   <li class="import-Normal" style="text-indent: 18pt">Look for patterns in the responses, and patterns from semester to semester, not just single responses or numbers. It is important to not over-interpret the numbers you receive. Some people may mistakenly interpret a single course rating as âgoodâ or âbadâ teaching based on whether it is above or below some arbitrary value.</li>
                   <li class="import-Normal" style="text-indent: 18pt">Teaching is very hard to do. There arenât silver bullets or recipes for perfect teaching. Every class, every student, every day is different. It can be difficult to interpret student feedback and use it to make improvements the next time you teach because of all these contextual factors. However, some teaching issues and problems are more common than others. Students bored with lectures? Not coming to class? Not doing the reading? Unprepared? Cheating? See this <a class="rId779" href="http://www.cmu.edu/teaching/solveproblem/step1-problem/index.html">Solve a Teaching Problem</a> site from CMU for advice on dealing with common problems.</li>
                   <li class="import-Normal" style="text-indent: 18pt">You can also meet with your teaching support for help with interpreting and addressing the feedback you received on your courses. They can help put the studentsâ feedback in context, and recommend strategies for addressing any valid issues or concerns the students bring up. They can observe and/or survey your students to further help you improve your course.</li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Other Questions about Student Evaluations</h3>
              <h4>Donât higher student ratings just mean that the course was easier or grade inflated? Or the instructor was more friendly or attractive?</h4>
              <p>There are some factors that influence student ratings that donât relate to learning, or even <a class="rId781" href="http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/everybody-is-stupid-except-you/201305/do-the-best-professors-get-the-worst-ratings">negatively correlate</a> with learning. But that doesnât mean student ratings and feedback are completely useless. Student ratings correlate the most with <em>expected grade</em> rather than actual grade. If a student comes into your course expecting an A but fails the first midterm or receives a C in the course, for example, they may punish you in their rating. Thus, as suggested in the tips below, you need to manage their expectations from the beginning of the semester, as well as emphasize your own high expectations for their hard work and effort. Think about why might they have the wrong expectations (calculus is different in college than in high school, for example), and consider <a class="rId783" href="https://canvas.instructure.com/courses/3312546/pages/strategies-to-help-struggling-students-turn-it-around">meeting with students who are struggling in your course</a> to discuss the issue and perhaps help them with effective time management and study skills.</p>
              <h4>Arenât student comments often just whining?</h4>
              <p>Students might be blunt or upset in their comments at times, but that does not necessarily mean that there is no basis for their comments or that their feedback should be ignored. Try to translate student feedback into constructive changes and improvements in your teaching.</p>
              <h3><a id="_r71raza5rqhs"></a>Tips for Increasing Your Student Ratings</h3>
              <p class="import-Normal">There are no silver bullets or magic formulas to good ratings, but here are some strategies that have been shown to improve student ratings and engagement.</p>
              <ul>
                   <li class="import-Normal" style="text-indent: 18pt">Conduct a <a class="rId785" href="https://canvas.instructure.com/courses/3312546/pages/midterm-student-feedback-surveys">Midterm Student Feedback (MSF) survey</a> with your students in the middle of the semester, rather than waiting until the end of the semester when it is too late to make any changes. Ask a colleague or staff member to visit and observe your class, if possible. During the last 10-15 minutes of the class, the instructor leaves, and students fill out an anonymous three question survey. The staff member emphasizes that this survey is completely anonymous and is being conducted at the request of the instructor â it is not about evaluating the instructor, but about getting feedback for improving the course. The three questions basically ask students what has helped their learning in the course, what has hindered their learning, and what the students can do themselves to enhance their own learning (such as study groups, tutoring, using online resources). The class as a whole discusses their answers â this helps students identify and add items they may agree with but did not think of themselves initially. The staff member will later send you a summary of the studentsâ responses, along with recommendations for addressing any issues the students have raised. It is recommended that you thank or acknowledge the students for providing you with feedback that can be used to improve the course. Research studies have shown that this process is a win-win for everyone involved. Instructors receive feedback from students and expert advice on how to improve their course. Students in turn appreciate having a voice in the class and may respond with higher ratings on the end of course evaluation.</li>
                   <li class="import-Normal" style="text-indent: 18pt">From the very beginning of the course, emphasize the course learning outcomes and set high expectations. Student evaluation scores correlate with <em>expected</em> grade. You have to be clear with students about the work and effort expected of them to succeed in the course, otherwise poor performance may be unexpected, and students will be more likely to respond negatively on course evaluations.</li>
                   <li class="import-Normal" style="text-indent: 18pt"><a href="#_1ff31s9ye65o">Connect your course to the real-world (contextualized learning)</a>. Do your students know how the topics in your course apply to the real world? Or are they given opportunities to apply their knowledge in real-world contexts, such as projects? Do you talk about your own research or bring in outside researchers or show videos of professionals applying the knowledge learned in your course? Or are you teaching the topic very abstractly with little or no real-world context. Students will be much more engaged, motivated, and persistent if they know why the topics they are learning are important and how they apply to their own interests and to the real-world. This in turn should positively influence student ratings of the course.</li>
                   <li class="import-Normal" style="text-indent: 18pt">Meet with your students, especially when they are struggling or low-performing, and increase the amount of <a class="rId787" href="https://bit.ly/ctlefsi">student-faculty contact</a> in your course.</li>
              </ul>

         <h2>Practical and Pedagogical Considerations for Live Videoconferencing</h2>
         <p>Microsoft Teams is a great tool, but for your course as a whole, please consider making your course as asynchronous as possible instead of primarily using a live, synchronous mode of delivery if you can.Â  That is more convenient for you (you can record your lessons on your own time) and for your students, who may have technological and other types of hurdles to participating in videoconferences.Â  It&#8217;s also more effective pedagogically.Â  You could have students watch a short pre-recorded video lecture and follow-up on that with a discussion board activity or quiz or assignment.Â  Live videoconferencing is more appropriate for things such as one-on-one meetings, small group meetings, virtual office hours, etc.</p>
         <p>If you do use a videoconferencing tool for lectures, two things are very important for success:</p>
         <ol>
              <li>Test out the videoconference tool first with your colleagues or students before having a &#8220;real&#8221; lecture session, and</li>
              <li><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/record-a-meeting-in-teams-34dfbe7f-b07d-4a27-b4c6-de62f1348c24">Record your videoconference sessions</a>, as there will likely be several students who cannot attend or participate in the live session for various reasons.</li>
         </ol>
         <h3>Issues with Live Videoconferences</h3>
         <p>Your students may not have access to a good Internet connection or a computer at the time you want to meet virtually.Â  They may be busy with other more important things: moving home, taking care of their family, etc.Â  They may have problems getting their microphone to work.</p>
         <p>You may run into other technical issues, too, which is another reason why it may be preferable to pre-record your lessons on your laptop and interact with your students asynchronously, for example via a <a href="https://community.canvaslms.com/videos/1109-discussions-overview-instructors">discussion board activity</a>.</p>

         <p>Here are some tips and resources for creating more pedagogically effective videos for your courses.</p>
         <h2>Pedagogical Uses for Videos</h2>
         <p>Tony Bates lists some different pedagogical uses for videos in his book <a href="https://pressbooks.bccampus.ca/teachinginadigitalagev3m/chapter/9-5-3-video/"><em>Teaching in a Digital Age</em></a>:</p>
         <ul>
              <li>Demonstrate experiments or phenomena</li>
              <li>Illustrate principles involving dynamic change or movement</li>
              <li>Illustrate principles involving 3D space</li>
              <li>Illustrate abstract principles with physical models</li>
              <li>Substitute for a field visit</li>
              <li>Bring students primary resource or case study material</li>
              <li>Demonstrate how abstract principles or concepts apply to real-world problems</li>
              <li>Demonstrate decision-making processes</li>
              <li>Demonstrate correct procedures for using tools or equipment</li>
              <li>Demonstrate methods or techniques of performance</li>
              <li>Record and archive events important to topics in a course</li>
         </ul>
         <h2>Recording Your Own Screencast Videos</h2>
         <p>These record what you do on the computer screen as well as your microphone, sort of like Khan Academy videos.</p>
         <ul>
              <li><a href="https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Canvas-Studio-Guide/tkb-p/studio">Canvas Studio</a> â video platform integrated with Canvas. Canvas Studio supports webcam videos, screencast videos, as well as video quizzes. Make sure you <a href="https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Canvas-Studio-Guide/How-do-I-use-the-Caption-Editor-to-edit-a-caption-file/ta-p/558638">edit and publish captions</a> for all your videos.</li>
              <li><a href="https://screenpal.com/">ScreenPal</a> (formerly Screencast-o-Matic) â very reliable tool, works on older computers, used underneath the hood by Canvas Studio</li>
              <li><a href="https://www.screencastify.com/">Screencastify</a> â works in Chrome browser with Google</li>
              <li><a href="https://obsproject.com/">OBS</a> â Open Broadcast Software â free and open source</li>
              <li><a href="https://www.techsmith.com/video-editor.html">Camtasia</a>($) â commercial option that includes extra features like video editing</li>
         </ul>
         <p>There are also apps for iPhone/iPad and Android for recording lessons:</p>
         <ul>
              <li><a href="https://explaineverything.com/">Explain Everything</a> â best tool especially if you use PowerPoint, but costs a little if you want to create more than 3 videos</li>
              <li><a href="https://www.showme.com/">ShowMe</a></li>
              <li><a href="https://www.maketecheasier.com/android-screen-recording-apps/">Android screen recording apps</a></li>
         </ul>
         <h2>Options for Sharing Your Videos</h2>
         <ul>
              <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/">Youtube</a> â share your videos publicly or keep them unlisted.&nbsp; You can create a separate playlist or Youtube channel to organize all your course videos.&nbsp; Be sure to <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2734705?hl=en">edit the captions</a> for accessibility.</li>
              <li><a href="https://vimeo.com/">Vimeo</a> â for videos you want to share publicly but they are too long for Youtube</li>
              <li>Canvas Studio â internal video platform</li>
         </ul>
         <h2>Interactive Video: Embed Questions In or After Your Videos</h2>
         <p>These tools let you embed questions in your video to add some interactivity and help ensure students are actually watching them:</p>
         <ul>
              <li><a href="#chapter-h5p">H5P</a> â free and open source collection of dozens of tools for adding interactivity to your course, including one for interactive videos linked here</li>
              <li><a href="https://go.playposit.com/">PlayPosit</a></li>
              <li><a href="https://edpuzzle.com/">Edpuzzle</a></li>
         </ul>
         <p>You can also add questions without using these tools.&nbsp; You might <a href="https://community.canvaslms.com/docs/DOC-12691-4152724196">embed your video</a> at the top of a <a href="https://community.canvaslms.com/docs/DOC-10460-canvas-instructor-guide-table-of-contents#jive_content_id_Quizzes">Canvas quiz</a>, for example, and ask them to answer questions after watching the video.</p>
         <h2 id="tips2">Technological Tips</h2>
         <h3>Keep your videos short</h3>
         <ul>
              <li>The <a class="inline_disabled" href="https://eddl.tru.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/EDDL5101_W5_Guo_2013.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">optimal length for educational videos is under 6 minutes</a>.&nbsp; Students tend to tune out on longer videos.</li>
              <li>Consider breaking your topic up into smaller segments spread across multiple videos.</li>
         </ul>
         <h3>Good audio is key</h3>
         <ul>
              <li>It is much harder to pay attention to and understand a video when the audio is not clear or is muffled or there is background noise.</li>
              <li>Find a nice quiet place to record your screencasts.</li>
              <li>You can get a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=usb+headset&amp;ref=nb_sb_noss_1">USB headset</a>, for example, or a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=blue+microphone&amp;ref=nb_sb_noss_1">Blue microphone</a> for even better quality.</li>
         </ul>
         <h3>Donât worry about making your videos âperfectâ</h3>
         <ul>
              <li>Your videos may not have the polish and editing that professionally-made videos have, but they can still be effective for learning. Even editing your own videos is often unnecessary if you plan appropriately.</li>
              <li>Plan ahead â create a bulleted list of items you want to cover (or even a script or storyboard if you so desire) so that you do not miss something important, and so that you can pace yourself. Prepare the items you want to show in advance so students donât have to wait while your software program launches or while you search for some file or resource.</li>
              <li>Start the video on your opening slide or some resource that signifies the topic of the video. If using a whiteboard or drawing software, draw the âtitleâ of the topic at the beginning (or before the video starts). This is so that you donât have to edit the video later to insert a title sequence.</li>
              <li>If you find yourself losing track of your place or you have to cough or something like that, just pause the recording, and then unpause again when you are ready. That way you donât have to start all over. If you make a mistake that is not too major, just explain it and fix it while still recording. If you made a mistake, most likely some of your students will, too, and it helps pedagogically to discuss common mistakes.</li>
              <li>Your first video or two, however, may take two or more takes. It takes practice to become comfortable speaking in a timed video. Go back and listen to your videos â are you speaking too fast? Is the audio loud enough? You might record a very short practice video first just to make sure everything is coming out okay.</li>
         </ul>
         <h3>Use HD Quality</h3>
         <ul>
              <li>In order to see the text or other small details in a screencast, you should record to HD quality video, and also during the video you might recommend to students that they press the full-screen button (on the bottom right of the video player if using Youtube) and/or switch to the HD quality version of the video (if it is on Youtube â see the gear icon for changing video quality).</li>
              <li>Recommended to size box in ScreenPal to âMedium HDâ for screencasts.</li>
         </ul>
         <h3>Zoom in, select, or annotate to focus the viewerâs attention</h3>
         <ul>
              <li>Even with HD quality videos, you can better help focus viewersâ attention by selecting, highlighting, marking, or even zooming into a particular aspect of the screen. Use your mouse as your pointer or as a way to provide gestures to focus attention. Many screencast tools will add a halo or circle around where the mouse is.</li>
         </ul>
         <h2>Pedagogical Tips</h2>
         <p>See also the article: <a href="https://faculty.uoit.ca/kay/files/pubs/video/Kay_2014_DevelopingFrameworkVideoPodcasts_IJET.pdf">Developing a Framework for Creating Effective Instructional Video Podcasts</a>.</p>
         <h3>Donât j<em>ust</em> make a video</h3>
         <ul>
              <li>Recording lessons is only the first step. The next step is replacing class time with more interactive activities. If one only records lectures and does nothing else, the pedagogical benefits will likely not be that significant.</li>
         </ul>
         <h3>Sequencing â Should students watch video lectures before or after active learning experiences?</h3>
         <ul>
              <li>Counter-intuitively, several research studies show that lectures are more effective <em>after</em> students have done some exploratory learning activity (like a lab, simulation, game, data analysis, etc.). When lecturing on the topic before students have had a chance to explore it or try it for themselves, students are more likely to tune out of the lecture and not retain much, because they do not see the need for learning it, or why the concepts are important, and what problems they solve. <em>After</em> students have had a chance to explore (and maybe fail) at something, they have more of a <em>need to know</em>. They have developed questions in their mind, they have run into problems that they couldnât solve. A lecture at that point helps them see the concepts and links between their experiences, and one can also connect the concepts covered in a lecture to the previous experiences the students have had.</li>
              <li>See research on <a href="http://ideas.time.com/2012/04/25/why-floundering-is-good/?iid=op-main-lede">productive failure</a></li>
              <li>You can make videos that are open-ended instead of just explanatory lectures that give students the âanswers.â You can ask students to watch a video that asks some open-ended inquiries and have students think or work on them before and during class.</li>
         </ul>
         <h3>Target misconceptions rather than only showing the âcorrectâ answers</h3>
         <ul>
              <li>Try to directly address potential misconceptions or mistakes and errors in the video, rather that just showing the âcorrectâ answer or technique. See this video on <a class="inline_disabled" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVtCO84MDj8">Khan Academy and the effectiveness of science videos</a> as an example.</li>
         </ul>
         <h3>Dialogue better than monologue</h3>
         <ul>
              <li>Like in the above video, there is a lot of research (e.g., <a href="https://asu.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/why-students-learn-more-from-dialogue-than-monologue-videos-analy">1</a>, <a href="https://nctm.confex.com/nctm/2016RP/webprogram/Session42210.html">2</a>) showing students learning more by watching a dialogue between multiple people from different perspectives rather than just a single person monologue.</li>
         </ul>
         <h3>Embed questions in or around your videos</h3>
         <ul>
              <li>As mentioned in the previous section, one suggestion is to not show the âanswerâ in a video, but ask open-ended questions of the students, and have students do the work and the learning.</li>
              <li>And as mentioned in the above Interactive Video section, you might consider embedding questions in or around your videos.&nbsp; This can have the dual effect of spurring your students to think more deeply about the concepts in the video <em>and</em> holding them accountable for watching the videos with something like a quiz.</li>
              <li>See also <a href="https://www.facultyfocus.com/articles/teaching-with-technology-articles/from-passive-viewing-to-active-learning-simple-techniques-for-applying-active-learning-strategies-to-online-course-videos/">From Passive Viewing to Active Learning: Simple Techniques for Applying Active Learning Strategies to Online Course Videos</a>.</li>
         </ul>
         <h3>Let students create the videos</h3>
         <ul>
              <li>Students enjoy making screencasts and teaching each other (and the world) topics they have learned.</li>
              <li>They could either use their phones and the Youtube app to record and share videos, or you might use a video discussion board like <a href="https://community.canvaslms.com/groups/strategies/blog/2018/09/27/using-flipgrid-in-canvas">FlipGrid, which integrates with Canvas</a>.</li>
              <li>Hereâs just one study showing the benefits of student-generated videos: <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10511970.2017.1396568?journalCode=upri20">Video Made the Calculus Star</a></li>

              <li>If I record my lectures, will the university own that content and potentially replace me?&nbsp; Iâd recommend recording your own videos and uploading them to Youtube, so that not only do you keep control over the videos (and you can take them down when you want), but also so that people outside the university can also benefit and learn from your videos.</li>
              <li>If you work with the university to create videos, discuss any issues or concerns you have with your supervisor.</li>
         </ul>
         <h3>Copyright</h3>
         <ul>
              <li>An exception to the above suggestion of using Youtube is if you video uses copyrighted materials from someone else, such as a publisher.&nbsp; While you have <a href="https://copyright.columbia.edu/basics/fair-use/fair-use-checklist.html">fair use</a> to use copyrighted materials for teaching purposes with your own students, you canât really share those materials outside the scope of your teaching.&nbsp; So for example if you are recording a screencast using a PowerPoint from your textbook publisherâs site, for example, I would put share it on Panopto or Microsoft Stream (and not Youtube), so that only students here can view it.</li>
         </ul>
         <h3>Class Attendance</h3>
         <ul>
              <li>If you record your lectures, will students skip class?&nbsp; There is some research that your class attendance might dip very slightly if you record your lectures.&nbsp; But you can counteract this by increasing accountability and interactivity in your classes.&nbsp; Start your class off with a question that students might answer related to the video, for example, or have an attendance policy, or add some required group activities to your class sessions.</li>
         </ul>
         <h3>Student Resistance</h3>
         <ul>
              <li>If you pre-record videos, try peer instruction, or try anything new or different or out of the norm of traditional teaching approaches, yes, you might expect a small amount of resistance, although the research shows that actually students show greater satisfaction in classes that use these kinds of techniques.&nbsp; Still, I would recommend framing what you are doing with students: explain to them why you are doing this, why it will benefit them (perhaps share research), and basically sell them on your teaching strategy.&nbsp; You may have to periodically remind your students of why you are doing this, instead of only explaining it to them at the beginning of the semester.</li>
              <li>Here are some <a href="#chapter-resistance">resources on reducing student resistance when you try something new in your courses</a>.</li>

              <p><em>âOpen Education is the development of free digitally enabled learning materials and experiences primarily by and for the benefit and empowerment of non-privileged learners who may be under-represented in education systems or marginalized in their global contextâ (<a href="https://jl4d.org/index.php/ejl4d/article/view/290/334">Lambert, 2018</a>).</em></p>

         <h2>Justification for Open Educational Resources (OERs) and Open Textbooks</h2>
         <p>Some students are unable to obtain instructional materials prior to the start of the term due to either a lack of financial resources or a lack of physical access.</p>
         <p>According to the 2018 Florida Textbook Survey, textbook prices have risen 88% in the last decade (4 times the rate of inflation), and 50% of students spend more than $300 a semester. As a result:<br />
          </p>
         <ul>
              <li>64% of students skipped purchasing a textbook</li>
         </ul>
         <ul>
              <li>86% of students delayed purchasing a textbook</li>
         </ul>
         <ul>
              <li>43% of students take fewer courses</li>
         </ul>
         <ul>
              <li>36% of students earn poorer grades</li>
         </ul>
         <ul>
              <li>23% of students dropped a course</li>
         </ul>
         <h3>OER Improves Student Success &amp; Equity</h3>
         <ul>
              <li>âOER improve end-of-course grades and decrease DFW (D, F, and Withdrawal letter grades) rates for all students.</li>
              <li>They also improve course grades at greater rates and decrease DFW rates at greater rates for Pell recipient students, part-time students, and populations historically underserved by higher education.</li>
              <li>OER address affordability, completion, attainment gap concerns, and learningâ (<a href="https://www.isetl.org/ijtlhe/pdf/IJTLHE3386.pdf">Covard et al., 2018</a>).</li>

         <p>If you do not make some changes to your teaching and/or course design, there is a risk that some students may use AI tools to cheat. Try submitting your assignments, discussion prompts, and test questions to an AI chat tool like ChatGPT to see how well it performs. Several studies are finding that ChatGPT can often complete academic tasks at the level of a graduate student. Below are some resources with strategies for adapting your teaching to be either more AI-resistant or AI-embracing.</p>

         <h2>Doâs and Don&#8217;ts When Using ChatGPT &amp; Similar Tools</h2>
         <ul>
              <li>Do try ChatGPT and similar tools yourself &#8211; Submit some of your own assignments or questions to see the responses generated. Check for any errors and false information.</li>
              <li>Donât use <a href="https://brentaanders.medium.com/ai-text-detection-and-how-to-better-address-the-issue-7f3f3e55fba4">AI detectors</a> &#8211; They have <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19148">low accuracy rates</a>, are <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11156">not reliable</a>, are <a href="https://mastodon.social/@dougholton/109778777373124873">very easy to beat</a>, and may <a href="https://marcwatkins.substack.com/p/its-time-to-step-off-the-ai-panic?sd=pf">collect and use student work and data</a>. Donât use it as a sole source of evidence.</li>
              <li>Do consider adding an AI policy to your syllabus &#8211; See these <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RMVwzjc1o0Mi8Blw_-JUTcXv02b2WRH86vw7mi16W3U">sample course policies</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.umass.edu/ctl/how-do-i-consider-options-may-increase-likelihood-students-will-follow-my-generative-ai-course">flowchart</a>.</li>
              <li>Do consider making your assessments more authentic, open, collaborative &#8211; Try <a href="https://alternative-assessment.com/?page_id=219">authentic assessment</a>, <a href="https://openpedagogy.org/examples/">open pedagogy</a>, <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/tls/files/tls/pa-resource-doc-final.pdf">peer assessment</a>, or <a href="https://info.flip.com/">video discussions</a>. See also <a href="https://drphilippahardman.substack.com/p/the-future-of-assessment">AI-powered education</a>.</li>
              <li>Donât be <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/chatbot-ftc-chatgpt-hype-scam-fraud-ai-artificial-intelligence-2023-3">scammed</a> â In many cases, itâs not really necessary to pay for these AI tools. <a href="https://www.controlaltachieve.com/2024/03/ai-tools-and-student-data-privacy.html">Donât reveal personal or financial information</a> when using these tools.</li>
              <li>Do see if these tools might assist you in your teaching &#8211; They might save you time &amp; assist with generating assessments, lesson plans, and even <a href="https://blog.tcea.org/chatgpt-grading/">grading</a>, but use ethically.</li>
         </ul>
         <h3>If you are using ChatGPT or similar tools in your courses:</h3>
         <ul>
              <li>Do explain to students why you are using AI tool &#8211; Think <a href="https://blog.mahabali.me/educational-technology-2/ideas-for-introducing-ai-in-class-chatgpt-openaichatgpt-ailiteracy/">how you will introduce ChatGPT</a>. What knowledge &amp; skills will they gain? Consider building studentsâ <a href="https://canvas.sydney.edu.au/courses/51655">AI literacy</a>, addressing misconceptions.</li>
              <li>Do see guides for more effectively using AI in teaching &#8211; Such as <a href="https://usergeneratededucation.wordpress.com/2023/01/22/chatgpt-with-my-students/">Ideas for Using ChatGPT in Education</a>, <a href="https://digital.uni-hohenheim.de/fileadmin/einrichtungen/digital/Generative_AI_and_ChatGPT_in_Higher_Education.pdf">Unlocking the Power of Generative AI for Higher Education</a>, &amp; <a href="https://www.iesalc.unesco.org/en/2023/04/14/chatgpt-and-artificial-intelligence-in-higher-education-quick-start-guide-and-interactive-seminar/">UNESCO AI Quick Start Guide</a>.</li>
              <li>Do consider having your students ask or discuss questions before or after using AI &#8211; The same goes with <a href="https://canvas.instructure.com/courses/3312546/pages/effective-videos">videos</a> &amp; <a href="https://canvas.instructure.com/courses/3312546/pages/tips-for-getting-students-to-do-the-reading">readings</a>. You and your students could <a href="https://web.hypothes.is/">annotate</a> and revise ChatGPTâs responses, for example.</li>
              <li>Donât require students to use AI tools, or else provide alternatives &#8211; Provide alternative options for students, or give them the option of submitting prompts to you to submit to AI tools.</li>
              <li>Donât depend on these tools working in a live class &#8211; Sometimes the servers are overloaded. If your entire class connects to an AI tool at the same time, they may be blocked.</li>
              <li>Do learn how to write better prompts &#8211; See these <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Lo4aeiWT4f5xhcsAbWAfQRITghBhcmFN2m-JEX5OkJA/edit?usp=sharing">sample teaching prompts</a> or a <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/15qAxnUzOwAPwHzoaKBJd8FAgiOZYcIxq/view">teacher guide</a> or this <a href="https://www.promptingguide.ai/">prompt engineering guide</a>.

              <li>Do learn about other AI tools beyond ChatGPT &#8211; See <a href="https://www.futurepedia.io/">FuturePedia</a> for over 5000!</li>
              <li>Do be on the lookout for more open and ethical alternatives &#8211; <a href="https://opening-up-chatgpt.github.io/">Open source AI models</a> are available.

              <p class="import-Normal">Use Ally and the Canvas Link Validator to check for accessibility issues in your Canvas courses. The bottom of this page has more info and tutorials. There are some issues they may miss, however (see below). First, letâs look at accessibility more generally.</p>
              <h3><a id="_1wdtahlkk0a1"></a>Why is Accessibility Important (and the Law)?</h3>
              <p class="import-Normal">All students should have equal, barrier-free access to college and course materials. The goal of full course accessibility is for all students to be able to interact with course content and engage with the instructor. Accessibility is a legal requirement, and there are ethical and pedagogical reasons for making your courses accessible, as well.</p>
              <p class="import-Normal">Integrating accessibility into online course materials is crucial for fostering an inclusive and equitable educational environment. While it may initially appear as an additional task, the importance and necessity of ensuring that all course materials are accessible to every student cannot be overstated. Below are the ethical, legal, educational, and professional imperatives for making online course content accessible.</p>
              <h4><a id="_eroj4oewyual"></a>Ethical Responsibility</h4>
              <p class="import-Normal">Providing equal learning opportunities is a fundamental ethical duty for educators. Accessibility is not merely a technical requirement; it is a matter of fairness and justice. Students with disabilities deserve the same opportunities to succeed as their peers. Ensuring that educational materials are accessible guarantees that all students, regardless of their physical or cognitive abilities, can fully participate in their education. This commitment to inclusivity reflects core educational values of equity and respect (Burgstahler, 2020).</p>
              <h4><a id="_8vcpg8jurdgr"></a>Legal Obligations</h4>
              <p class="import-Normal">Educational institutions must comply with legal mandates such as the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the Rehabilitation Act (Section 504), which require equal access to educational opportunities for all students (U.S. Department of Education, 2021). Non-compliance can lead to significant legal repercussions, including lawsuits and loss of federal funding. Ensuring accessibility protects institutions from these risks and underscores a commitment to legal and ethical standards.</p>
              <h4><a id="_fe1rsymj7n"></a>Enhanced Learning for All</h4>
              <p class="import-Normal">Accessibility benefits the entire student body, not just those with disabilities. The principles of Universal Design for Learning (UDL) advocate for creating materials that accommodate a wide range of learning needs, thereby improving the learning experience for everyone (CAST, 2018). For instance, captions on videos assist not only students with hearing impairments but also non-native English speakers and those who prefer to read along while listening. Clear, well-organized documents aid in comprehension and retention for all students. Ultimately, accessible materials lead to better teaching and learning outcomes for the entire classroom (Rose &amp; Meyer, 2002).</p>
              <h4><a id="_clhc54mir105"></a>Quality of Education</h4>
              <p class="import-Normal">Accessible course materials often result in higher-quality content. Striving for accessibility encourages educators to pay greater attention to clarity, organization, and usability. This focus enhances the overall effectiveness and engagement of teaching materials (Tobin, 2014). Additionally, accessible courses can reach a broader audience, including lifelong learners, working professionals, and international students, thereby extending the impact and reputation of educational programs.</p>
              <h4><a id="_ndrc7j3312es"></a>Professional Growth</h4>
              <p class="import-Normal">Embracing accessibility is a valuable opportunity for professional development. Learning to create accessible materials and incorporating UDL principles can enhance teaching skills and increase versatility and effectiveness as an educator (Scott, McGuire, &amp; Shaw, 2003). These skills are increasingly in demand and can differentiate educators in a competitive academic environment.</p>
              <h3><a id="_rloy3h5nwang"></a>Misconceptions About Accessibility</h3>
              <p class="import-Normal">Here are some common arguments and misconceptions against making online courses accessible for students, along with refutations for each:</p>
              <h4><a id="_u4octtlzvdsz"></a>1. Itâs Too Expensive</h4>
              <p class="import-Normal"><strong>Misconception:</strong> Making courses accessible requires a significant financial investment that institutions cannot afford.</p>
              <p class="import-Normal"><strong>Refutation:</strong> While there may be initial costs associated with making online courses accessible, the long-term benefits far outweigh these costs. Accessibility ensures that more students can participate in and complete courses, potentially increasing enrollment and retention rates. Additionally, many accessibility features, like using proper HTML tags or providing text descriptions, are low-cost or free.</p>
              <h4><a id="_oeyfw8hv83u1"></a>2. It Takes Too Much Time</h4>
              <p class="import-Normal"><strong>Misconception:</strong> Making courses accessible is too time-consuming for instructors and course developers.</p>
              <p class="import-Normal"><strong>Refutation:</strong> While integrating accessibility features can take time initially, many practices, such as using accessible templates or tools, can streamline the process. Once instructors become familiar with accessibility guidelines, the additional time required becomes minimal. Moreover, accessibility improvements often benefit all students, not just those with disabilities. Artificial Intelligence tools can greatly speed up making course materials accessible.</p>
              <h4><a id="_ol6i1qwrw8rq"></a>3. Only a Few Students Benefit</h4>
              <p class="import-Normal"><strong>Misconception:</strong> Accessibility improvements are only necessary for a small percentage of students, so the effort is not justified.</p>
              <p class="import-Normal"><strong>Refutation:</strong> Accessibility benefits a wide range of students, including those with temporary disabilities, non-native speakers, and students with different learning preferences. Universal design principles enhance the learning experience for everyone, not just those with documented disabilities.</p>
              <h4><a id="_fktiz54kvlwp"></a>4. Technical Complexity</h4>
              <p class="import-Normal"><strong>Misconception:</strong> Making online courses accessible is too technically complex and requires specialized knowledge that educators may not have.</p>
              <p class="import-Normal"><strong>Refutation:</strong> There are many resources, tools, and training programs available to help educators and developers learn how to make their courses accessible. Many learning management systems (LMS) have built-in accessibility features, and there are guidelines like the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) that provide clear instructions.</p>
              <h4><a id="_n0qiesel9osg"></a>5. Lack of Awareness</h4>
              <p class="import-Normal"><strong>Misconception:</strong> Educators are not aware of accessibility issues, so itâs not a priority.</p>
              <p class="import-Normal"><strong>Refutation:</strong> Increasing awareness through training and professional development can quickly elevate the importance of accessibility. Once educators understand the impact of accessibility on student success, they are more likely to prioritize it in their course design.</p>
              <h4><a id="_aq4kydw8lg2v"></a>6. Fear of Reducing Course Quality or Creativity</h4>
              <p class="import-Normal"><strong>Misconception:</strong> Accessibility requirements will stifle the creativity and quality of the course content.</p>
              <p class="import-Normal"><strong>Refutation:</strong> Accessibility does not hinder creativity; it often enhances it by encouraging innovative approaches to content delivery. Accessible design encourages the use of multiple formats and flexible options, which can lead to more engaging and inclusive courses.</p>
              <h4><a id="_lubmph3zhsnl"></a>7. Accessibility Features Will Be Misused</h4>
              <p class="import-Normal"><strong>Misconception:</strong> Students without disabilities will take advantage of accessibility features, leading to unfair advantages.</p>
              <p class="import-Normal"><strong>Refutation:</strong> Accessibility features are designed to level the playing field, not to give any group an unfair advantage. Furthermore, these features can support a diverse range of learning styles, which benefits the entire student body.</p>
              <h4><a id="_jjo9mg8pmdgk"></a>8. Itâs Not a Legal Requirement</h4>
              <p class="import-Normal"><strong>Misconception:</strong> There are no legal requirements to make online courses accessible.</p>
              <p class="import-Normal"><strong>Refutation:</strong> In many regions, including the United States and European Union, there are legal requirements for educational institutions to provide accessible learning environments. Non-compliance can result in legal consequences and damage to the institutionâs reputation.</p>
              <h4><a id="_4j8rzrvw6i3u"></a>9. Misunderstanding of Accessibility Scope</h4>
              <p class="import-Normal"><strong>Misconception:</strong> Accessibility is only about adding captions or transcripts.</p>
              <p class="import-Normal"><strong>Refutation:</strong> Accessibility encompasses a wide range of considerations, including website navigation, screen reader compatibility, visual design, keyboard accessibility, and more. It is about creating an inclusive learning environment that considers various needs and preferences.</p>
              <h4><a id="_31fe0s7p77tl"></a>10. Perception of Accessibility as an Afterthought</h4>
              <p class="import-Normal"><strong>Misconception:</strong> Accessibility can be added after the course is created, if needed.</p>
              <p class="import-Normal"><strong>Refutation:</strong> Accessibility should be integrated from the beginning of course design. Retrofitting accessibility features can be more challenging and costly than incorporating them from the start. Proactive design ensures that all students can access the content without delays or additional barriers.</p>

              <ul>
                   <li class="import-Normal" style="text-indent: 18pt">Modules â Use the modules page as the primary place where you build and organize your course. Think of it as the table of contents or outline or to-do list for your course. If you have a reading or assignment or discussion for a particular week or unit, add it to the module for that week or unit. This way, everything associated with that week or unit will be more visible to you and your students. You can see in a glance if something is not available or unpublished that shouldnât be, or if a requirement was not set, and so forth. See <a class="rId1281" href="https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Instructor-Guide/How-do-I-add-a-module/ta-p/1151">How do I add a module?</a> and <a class="rId1283" href="https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Instructor-Guide/How-do-I-add-course-content-as-module-items/ta-p/1157">How do I add assignment types, pages, and files as module items?</a></li>
                   <li class="import-Normal" style="text-indent: 18pt">Donât Copy &amp; Paste â Donât copy from other courses or websites or documents into Canvas. If you do, the text will copy over just fine (although it may mess up the text styles and fonts), but images will not copy over like they would when copying and pasting into a Word document. Images have to be downloaded from the other site (right click on the image and choose âsave image asâ), and then you can <a class="rId1285" href="https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Instructor-Guide/How-do-I-upload-and-embed-an-image-in-the-Rich-Content-Editor-as/ta-p/784">upload and insert the image into Canvas</a>, entering <a class="rId1287" href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/everything-you-need-to-know-to-write-effective-alt-text-df98f884-ca3d-456c-807b-1a1fa82f5dc2">descriptive alt text</a> when doing so. When copying content from another Canvas course, <a class="rId1289" href="https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Instructor-Guide/How-do-I-copy-content-from-another-Canvas-course-using-the/ta-p/1012">use the course import tool</a> to ensure all images and links are fixed. Use the <a class="rId1290" href="https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Instructor-Guide/How-do-I-validate-links-in-a-course/ta-p/1001">link validator</a> to check for any broken images or links.</li>
                   <li class="import-Normal" style="text-indent: 18pt">Images â When inserting an image, always remember to set the alt text with a description of what is in the image for screen readers. If you want to embed a very large image, reduce its file size with a <a class="rId1292" href="https://www.techradar.com/news/the-best-free-online-photo-editor">photo editor</a> first. See: <a class="rId1294" href="https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Instructor-Guide/How-do-I-embed-images-from-Canvas-into-the-Rich-Content-Editor/ta-p/856">How do I embed images from Canvas into the Rich Content Editor?</a></li>
                   <li class="import-Normal" style="text-indent: 18pt">Tables â Minimize your use of tables, but when you do use them, set a caption and header row or column in the table properties. Do not set the width of a table or table cell to a fixed value, use percentages instead. Reduce the number of columns for readability on mobile devices. See <a class="rId1296" href="https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Instructor-Guide/How-do-I-insert-a-table-using-the-Rich-Content-Editor-as-an/ta-p/982">How do I insert a table using the Rich Content Editor?</a></li>
                   <li class="import-Normal" style="text-indent: 18pt">Text Color â You should not use color or font size alone to distinguish text or convey importance. Use headers. See <a class="rId1298" href="https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Instructor-Guide/How-do-I-add-and-modify-text-in-the-Rich-Content-Editor-as-an/ta-p/818">How do I add and modify text in the Rich Content Editor?</a> Check that color contrast is sufficient using this <a class="rId1300" href="https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/">Color Contrast Checker from WebAIM</a>.</li>
                   <li class="import-Normal" style="text-indent: 18pt">Videos â Speak clearly when recording videos and audio so that <a class="rId1302" href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6373554?hl=en">automatic captions</a> will be more accurate and save you time with making any corrections. Also, check that in the Canvas Student app the video can play full-screen.

              <p class="import-Normal"><a class="rId1317" href="https://help.blackboard.com/Ally/Ally_for_LMS/Instructor">Ally</a> is a tool for proactive accessibility that integrates with <a class="rId1319" href="#chapter-canvas">Canvas</a>. Ally helps build a more inclusive learning environment and improve the student experience by helping faculty take clear control of course content with usability, accessibility, and quality in mind.</p>
              <h4>Limitations of Ally</h4>
              <p class="import-Normal">Some things Ally doesnât catch include:</p>
              <ul>
                   <li class="import-Normal" style="text-indent: 18pt">Ally canât check your publisher site or other external resources.</li>
                   <li class="import-Normal" style="text-indent: 18pt">Ally will tell you what images need alt text descriptions, but you will need to <a href="https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Instructor-Guide/How-do-I-manage-alt-text-and-display-options-for-images-embedded/ta-p/951" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-interception="off">add alt text to images in the Canvas rich content editor</a> rather than in Ally to ensure the alt text copies to the next course.</li>
                   <li class="import-Normal" style="text-indent: 18pt">Ally canât detect broken links or broken links to images or files. Instead use the built-in Canvas link validator under Settings. See: <a class="rId1321" href="https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Instructor-Guide/How-do-I-validate-links-in-a-course/ta-p/1001">How do I validate links in a course?</a></li>
                   <li class="import-Normal" style="text-indent: 18pt">Ally may not accurately detect if a video has accurate captions/transcript (with proper punctuation, etc.). If you canât edit and fix the captions yourself (such as with someone elseâs YouTube video), there are some AI tools that can generate much more accurate transcripts, such as Whisper from OpenAI.</li>
                   <li class="import-Normal" style="text-indent: 18pt">Ally can detect if an image has a description (alt text) or not, but not if the alt text accurately describes the content of the image. For making complex charts or diagrams accessible, see resources such as these:

              <li><a href="https://web.hypothes.is/">Hypothesis</a> &#8211; a free, open source social web &amp; document annotation tool.Â  Use this tool more for articles and web pages, whereas Perusall leans more for toward textbooks.Â  There is integration between Hypothesis and Canvas available, but it is still in development.</li>

                             <p>Engaging students with readings in a college setting can be challenging, but there are several effective techniques instructors can use to encourage participation and comprehension:</p>
                             <h3>Active Learning Strategies</h3>
                             <ol>
                                  <li><strong>Discussion Questions:</strong> Provide thought-provoking questions related to the reading material to stimulate discussion.</li>
                                  <li><strong>Group Work:</strong> Organize small groups to discuss specific sections of the readings, then share their insights with the class.</li>
                                  <li><strong>Jigsaw Technique:</strong> Assign different sections of the reading to different groups, and then have them teach their section to the rest of the class.</li>
                             </ol>
                             <h3>Assessment and Accountability</h3>
                             <ol start="4">
                                  <li><strong>Reading Quizzes:</strong> Administer short quizzes at the beginning of the class to ensure students have completed the readings.</li>
                                  <li><strong>Reflection Papers:</strong> Ask students to write brief reflection papers on the readings, summarizing key points and their reactions.</li>
                                  <li><strong>Annotated Bibliographies:</strong> Have students create annotated bibliographies summarizing and evaluating the readings.</li>
                             </ol>
                             <h3>Incentives and Relevance</h3>
                             <ol start="7">
                                  <li><strong>Connect to Real Life:</strong> Relate the readings to real-world examples or current events to make the material more relevant.</li>
                                  <li><strong>Application Projects:</strong> Design projects or assignments that require students to apply concepts from the readings to practical scenarios.</li>
                                  <li><strong>Participation Grades:</strong> Include reading participation as part of the overall grade to emphasize its importance.</li>
                             </ol>
                             <h3>Use of Technology</h3>
                             <ol start="10">
                                  <li><strong>Online Forums:</strong> Create online discussion boards where students can post questions, comments, and engage in discussions about the readings.</li>
                                  <li><strong>Interactive Reading Platforms:</strong> Use platforms that allow for interactive annotations and note-sharing among students.</li>
                             </ol>
                             <h3>Scaffolding and Support</h3>
                             <ol start="12">

         <p>Here are some other techniques you can try mid-semester to help struggling students turn it around:</p>
         <ul>
              <li><strong>Boost engagement and faculty-student interaction</strong> with some of these easy-to-use <a href="https://www.engageengineering.org/fsi/takeaction">ideas to improve your students&#8217; participation, attitude, and learning</a> from EngageEngineering.Â  There are ideas that will help make students more comfortable reaching out to you for help and coming to office hours.Â  CSTeachingTips also has some <a href="http://csteachingtips.org/tips-for-encouraging-help-seeking">tips for encouraging help seeking</a>.</li>
              <li><strong>Proactively reach out to meet with or email students who struggled</strong> on your first quiz or exam or assignment. You might share these tips for <a href="http://www.math.toronto.edu/nhoell/10rules-of-studying.pdf">effective study skills</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/s/the-complete-guide-to-beating-procrastination/how-to-use-psychology-to-solve-the-procrastination-puzzle-6e6a56cdd535">overcoming procrastination</a>.Â  This can help students improve significantly.Â  See the study â<a href="http://www.cwsei.ubc.ca/SEI_research/files/Harris_Intervention_JCST2012.pdf">Transforming the Lowest-Performing Students: An Intervention That Worked</a>â &#8211; in particular the graph on the 4<sup>th</sup> page that shows improvement from the first to the second exam.</li>
              <li><strong>Use <a class="inline_disabled" href="https://www.interventioncentral.org/student_motivation_wise_feedback" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wise feedback</a></strong> &#8211; use growth mindset language in your feedback to students.</li>
              <li><strong>Teach effective learning strategies to your class</strong> by giving a lesson after the first exam (when students are more ready to hear this).Â  Hereâs a <a class="inline_disabled" href="https://www.routledge.com/Teach-Students-How-to-Learn-Strategies-You-Can-Incorporate-Into-Any-Course/McGuire/p/book/9781620363164" target="_blank" rel="noopener">example video presentation and slides on effective learning strategies</a> (under the Support Material section) from Saundra McGuire, author of the book <a class="inline_disabled" href="https://www.routledge.com/Teach-Students-How-to-Learn-Strategies-You-Can-Incorporate-Into-Any-Course/McGuire/p/book/9781620363164" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Teach Students How to Learn</em></a>, as well as a book for students, <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Teach-Yourself-How-Learn-Strategies/dp/1620367564">Teach Yourself How to Learn</a></em>.</li>
              <li><strong>Refer students to the student success coaches and tutors</strong> in your institution&#8217;s Academic Success Center.Â  Hereâs another study showing how doing so can improve studentâs performance: â<a href="https://ideas.repec.org/p/boc/bocoec/956.html">Early Intervention in College Classes and Improved Student Outcomes</a>.â</li>
              <li><strong>Try the <a href="http://www.cwsei.ubc.ca/resources/files/Two-stage_Exams.pdf">two-stage exam technique</a>.</strong> Students take a quiz or exam first individually, and then a second time in a group.Â  This can prevent struggling students from falling further and further behind, since they can learn from each other the things they missed in the first stage.Â  And you donât have to spend so much time reviewing the exam yourself.Â  Hereâs a <a href="http://blogs.ubc.ca/wpvc/two-stage-exams/">video</a> of it in action, as well as more <a class="instructure_file_link inline_disabled" href="https://www.eoas.ubc.ca/research/cwsei/eossei-times/EOSSEITimes_6.09-LogisticsOfTwoStageExams.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tips for success</a>.</li>
